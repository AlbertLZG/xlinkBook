Towardthis end, in the spirit of the SURE theory, a key step is to compute the (weak)derivative and divergence of a solution with respect to the observations. Assuch a solution is not available in closed form, but rather through a proximalsplitting algorithm, we propose to recursively compute the divergence from thesequence of iterates. A second challenge that we unlocked is the computation ofthe (weak) derivative of the proximity operator of a spectral function. To showthe potential applicability of our approach, we exemplify it on a matrixcompletion problem to objectively and automatically select the regularizationparameter.

The problem is challenging becauseof various types of influences propagating through the social media networkthat act simultaneously on any user. Additionally, the topic composition of theinfluencing factors and the susceptibility of users to these influences evolveover time. This problem has not studied before, and off-the-shelf models areunsuitable for this purpose. To capture the complex interplay of these variousfactors, we propose a new non-parametric model called the DynamicMulti-Relational Chinese Restaurant Process. This accounts for the user networkfor data generation and also allows the parameters to evolve over time.Designing inference algorithms for this model suited for large scalesocial-media data is another challenge. To this end, we propose a scalable andmulti-threaded inference algorithm based on online Gibbs Sampling. Extensiveevaluations on large-scale Twitter and Facebook data show that the extractedtopics when applied to authorship and commenting prediction outperformstate-of-the-art baselines. More importantly, our model produces valuableinsights on topic trends and user personality trends, beyond the capability ofexisting approaches.

Vast numbers of Spam emails are sentmainly from automatic botnets distributed over the world. One method formitigating Spam in a computationally efficient manner is fast and accurateblacklisting of the senders. In this work we propose a new sender reputationmechanism that is based on an aggregated historical data-set which encodes thebehavior of mail transfer agents over time. A historical data-set is createdfrom labeled logs of received emails. We use machine learning algorithms tobuild a model that predicts the \emph{spammingness} of mail transfer agents inthe near future. The proposed mechanism is targeted mainly at large enterprisesand email service providers and can be used for updating both the black and thewhite lists. We evaluate the proposed mechanism using 9.5M anonymized logentries obtained from the biggest Internet service provider in Europe.Experiments show that proposed method detects more than 94% of the Spam emailsthat escaped the blacklist (i.e., TPR), while having less than 0.5%false-alarms. Therefore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is muchhigher than of previously reported reputation mechanisms, which rely on emailslogs. In addition, the proposed method, when used for updating both the blackand white lists, eliminated the need in automatic content inspection of 4 outof 5 incoming emails, which resulted in dramatic reduction in the filteringcomputational load.

We consider the situation of a modelsimultaneously (a) penalized by a set- function de ned on the support of theunknown parameter vector which represents prior knowledge on supports, and (b)regularized in Lp-norm. We show that the natural combinatorial optimizationproblems obtained may be relaxed into convex optimization problems andintroduce a notion, the lower combinatorial envelope of a set-function, thatcharacterizes the tightness of our relaxations. We moreover establish linkswith norms based on latent representations including the latent group Lasso andblock-coding, and with norms obtained from submodular functions.

This problem appears in manyapplications ranging from finite element methods to visual tracking. From this,one can then hopefully utilize the proposed technique for shape analysis,registration, as well as other related computer graphics tasks. Moreimportantly, given that we seek to establish a one-to-one correspondence of aninput volume to that of a solid cube, our algorithm can naturally generate aquality hexahedral mesh as an output. In addition, we constrain the mappingitself to be volume preserving allowing for the possibility of further meshsimplification. We demonstrate our method both qualitatively and quantitativelyon various 3D solid models
arxiv-600-9 | On the Complexity of Trial and Error | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1183v2.pdf | author:Xiaohui Bei, Ning Chen, Shengyu Zhang category:cs.CC cs.DS cs.LG published:2012-05-06 summary:Motivated by certain applications from physics, biochemistry, economics, andcomputer science, in which the objects under investigation are not accessiblebecause of various limitations, we propose a trial-and-error model to examinealgorithmic issues in such situations. Given a search problem with a hiddeninput, we are asked to find a valid solution, to find which we can proposecandidate solutions (trials), and use observed violations (errors), to preparefuture proposals. In accordance with our motivating applications, we considerthe fairly broad class of constraint satisfaction problems, and assume thaterrors are signaled by a verification oracle in the format of the index of aviolated constraint (with the content of the constraint still hidden). Our discoveries are summarized as follows. On one hand, despite the seeminglyvery little information provided by the verification oracle, efficientalgorithms do exist for a number of important problems. For the Nash, Core,Stable Matching, and SAT problems, the unknown-input versions are as hard asthe corresponding known-input versions, up to a factor of polynomial. Wefurther give almost tight bounds on the latter two problems' trialcomplexities. On the other hand, there are problems whose complexities aresubstantially increased in the unknown-input model. In particular, notime-efficient algorithms exist (under standard hardness assumptions) for GraphIsomorphism and Group Isomorphism problems. The tools used to achieve theseresults include order theory, strong ellipsoid method, and some non-standardreductions. Our model investigates the value of information, and our results demonstratethat the lack of input information can introduce various levels of extradifficulty. The model exhibits intimate connections with (and we hope can alsoserve as a useful supplement to) certain existing learning and complexitytheories.

It ishowever a notoriously difficult problem, for which the many existing methodsreach limited accuracy. In this paper, we formulate GRN inference as a sparseregression problem and investigate the performance of a popular featureselection method, least angle regression (LARS) combined with stabilityselection. We introduce a novel, robust and accurate scoring technique forstability selection, which improves the performance of feature selection withLARS. The resulting method, which we call TIGRESS (Trustful Inference of GeneREgulation using Stability Selection), was ranked among the top methods in theDREAM5 gene network reconstruction challenge. We investigate in depth theinfluence of the various parameters of the method and show that a fineparameter tuning can lead to significant improvements and state-of-the-artperformance for GRN inference. TIGRESS reaches state-of-the-art performance onbenchmark data. This study confirms the potential of feature selectiontechniques for GRN inference. Code and data are available onhttp://cbio.ensmp.fr/~ahaury. Running TIGRESS online is possible onGenePattern: http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/.

The algorithm is applicable to a broad class ofconvex loss functions. Convergence of the algorithm is established, and thealgorithm is used to investigate the performance of the multinomial sparsegroup lasso classifier. On three different real data examples the multinomialgroup lasso clearly outperforms multinomial lasso in terms of achievedclassification error rate and in terms of including fewer features for theclassification. The run-time of our sparse group lasso implementation is of thesame order of magnitude as the multinomial lasso algorithm implemented in the Rpackage glmnet. Our implementation scales well with the problem size. One ofthe high dimensional examples considered is a 50 class classification problemwith 10k features, which amounts to estimating 500k parameters. Theimplementation is available as the R package msgl.
arxiv-600-12 | Rakeness in the design of Analog-to-Information Conversion of Sparse and Localized Signals | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1144v1.pdf | author:Mauro Mangia, Riccardo Rovatti, Gianluca Setti category:cs.IT cs.CV math.IT published:2012-05-05 summary:Design of Random Modulation Pre-Integration systems based on therestricted-isometry property may be suboptimal when the energy of the signalsto be acquired is not evenly distributed, i.e. when they are both sparse andlocalized. To counter this, we introduce an additional design criterion, thatwe call rakeness, accounting for the amount of energy that the measurementscapture from the signal to be acquired. Hence, for localized signals a propersystem tuning increases the rakeness as well as the average SNR of the samplesused in its reconstruction. Yet, maximizing average SNR may go against the needof capturing all the components that are potentially non-zero in a sparsesignal, i.e., against the restricted isometry requirement ensuringreconstructability. What we propose is to administer the trade-off betweenrakeness and restricted isometry in a statistical way by laying down anoptimization problem. The solution of such an optimization problem is thestatistic of the process generating the random waveforms onto which the signalis projected to obtain the measurements. The formal definition of such aproblems is given as well as its solution for signals that are either localizedin frequency or in more generic domain. Sample applications, to ECG signals andsmall images of printed letters and numbers, show that rakeness-based designleads to non-negligible improvements in both cases.

While most approaches use heuristics, biology suggests thatthere must exist an unsupervised method to construct such filtersautomatically. Besides the extraction of environmental states, the filters haveto represent them in a fashion that support modern reinforcement algorithms.Many popular algorithms use a linear architecture, so one should aim at filtersthat have good approximation properties in combination with linear functions.This thesis wants to propose the unsupervised method slow feature analysis(SFA) for this task. Presented with a random sequence of sensor readings, SFAlearns a set of filters. With growing model complexity and training examples,the filters converge against trigonometric polynomial functions. These areknown to possess excellent approximation capabilities and should therforesupport the reinforcement algorithms well. We evaluate this claim on a robot.The task is to learn a navigational control in a simple environment using theleast square policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm. The only accessible sensor is ahead mounted video camera, but without meaningful filtering, video images arenot suited as LSPI input. We will show that filters learned by SFA, based on arandom walk video of the robot, allow the learned control to navigatesuccessfully in ca. 80% of the test trials.
arxiv-600-14 | Non-negative least squares for high-dimensional linear models: consistency and sparse recovery without regularization | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0953v2.pdf | author:Martin Slawski, Matthias Hein category:math.ST stat.ML stat.TH published:2012-05-04 summary:Least squares fitting is in general not useful for high-dimensional linearmodels, in which the number of predictors is of the same or even larger orderof magnitude than the number of samples. Theory developed in recent years hascoined a paradigm according to which sparsity-promoting regularization isregarded as a necessity in such setting. Deviating from this paradigm, we showthat non-negativity constraints on the regression coefficients may be similarlyeffective as explicit regularization if the design matrix has additionalproperties, which are met in several applications of non-negative least squares(NNLS). We show that for these designs, the performance of NNLS with regard toprediction and estimation is comparable to that of the lasso. We argue furtherthat in specific cases, NNLS may have a better $\ell_{\infty}$-rate inestimation and hence also advantages with respect to support recovery whencombined with thresholding. From a practical point of view, NNLS does notdepend on a regularization parameter and is hence easier to use.

However, the vocabulary usually contains many wordsthat are not relevant in forming the topics. We adopt a variable selectionmethod widely used in statistical modeling as a dimension reduction tool andcombine it with LDA. In this variable selection model for LDA (vsLDA), topicsare multinomial distributions over a subset of the vocabulary, and by excludingwords that are not informative for finding the latent topic structure of thecorpus, vsLDA finds topics that are more robust and discriminative. We comparethree models, vsLDA, LDA with symmetric priors, and LDA with asymmetric priors,on heldout likelihood, MCMC chain consistency, and document classification. Theperformance of vsLDA is better than symmetric LDA for likelihood andclassification, better than asymmetric LDA for consistency and classification,and about the same in the other comparisons.

The weight can be interpreted as the frequencyof the pattern occurrence at the input of the network. In the framework of thestatistical physics approach we obtain the saddle-point equation allowing us toexamine the memory of the network. In the case of unequal weights our modeldoes not lead to the catastrophic destruction of the memory due to itsoverfilling (that is typical for the standard Hopfield model). The real memoryconsists only of the patterns with weights exceeding a critical value that isdetermined by the weights distribution. We obtain the algorithm allowing us tofind this critical value for an arbitrary distribution of the weights, andanalyze in detail some particular weights distributions. It is shown that thememory decreases as compared to the case of the standard Hopfield model.However, in our model the network can learn online without the catastrophicdestruction of the memory.

Kadie, David Heckerman category:q-bio.GN stat.AP stat.ML published:2012-05-03 summary:Approaches for testing sets of variants, such as a set of rare or commonvariants within a gene or pathway, for association with complex traits areimportant. In particular, set tests allow for aggregation of weak signal withina set, can capture interplay among variants, and reduce the burden of multiplehypothesis testing. Until now, these approaches did not address confounding byfamily relatedness and population structure, a problem that is becoming moreimportant as larger data sets are used to increase power. Results: We introduce a new approach for set tests that handles confounders.Our model is based on the linear mixed model and uses two random effects-one tocapture the set association signal and one to capture confounders. We alsointroduce a computational speedup for two-random-effects models that makes thisapproach feasible even for extremely large cohorts. Using this model with boththe likelihood ratio test and score test, we find that the former yields morepower while controlling type I error. Application of our approach to richlystructured GAW14 data demonstrates that our method successfully corrects forpopulation structure and family relatedness, while application of our method toa 15,000 individual Crohn's disease case-control cohort demonstrates that itadditionally recovers genes not recoverable by univariate analysis. Availability: A Python-based library implementing our approach is availableat http://mscompbio.codeplex.com

M. V. Satya Sriram category:cs.IT cs.LG math.IT published:2012-05-03 summary:Maximum entropy approach to classification is very well studied in appliedstatistics and machine learning and almost all the methods that exists inliterature are discriminative in nature. In this paper, we introduce a maximumentropy classification method with feature selection for large dimensional datasuch as text datasets that is generative in nature. To tackle the curse ofdimensionality of large data sets, we employ conditional independenceassumption (Naive Bayes) and we perform feature selection simultaneously, byenforcing a `maximum discrimination' between estimated class conditionaldensities. For two class problems, in the proposed method, we use Jeffreys($J$) divergence to discriminate the class conditional densities. To extend ourmethod to the multi-class case, we propose a completely new approach byconsidering a multi-distribution divergence: we replace Jeffreys divergence byJensen-Shannon ($JS$) divergence to discriminate conditional densities ofmultiple classes. In order to reduce computational complexity, we employ amodified Jensen-Shannon divergence ($JS_{GM}$), based on AM-GM inequality. Weshow that the resulting divergence is a natural generalization of Jeffreysdivergence to a multiple distributions case. As far as the theoreticaljustifications are concerned we show that when one intends to select the bestfeatures in a generative maximum entropy approach, maximum discrimination using$J-$divergence emerges naturally in binary classification. Performance andcomparative study of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated on largedimensional text and gene expression datasets that show our methods scale upvery well with large dimensional datasets.

However, most MIL algorithms are very slow andcannot be applied to large datasets. In this paper, we propose a greedystrategy to speed up the multiple instance learning process. Our contributionis two fold. First, we propose a density ratio model, and show that maximizinga density ratio function is the low bound of the DD model under certainconditions. Secondly, we make use of a histogram ratio between positive bagsand negative bags to represent the density ratio function and find codebooksseparately for positive bags and negative bags by a greedy strategy. Fortesting, we make use of a nearest neighbor strategy to classify new bags. Wetest our method on both small benchmark datasets and the large TRECVID MED11dataset. The experimental results show that our method yields comparableaccuracy to the current state of the art, while being up to at least one orderof magnitude faster.

The equivalence holds when energydistances are computed with semimetrics of negative type, in which case akernel may be defined such that the RKHS distance between distributionscorresponds exactly to the energy distance. We determine the class ofprobability distributions for which kernels induced by semimetrics arecharacteristic (that is, for which embeddings of the distributions to an RKHSare injective). Finally, we investigate the performance of this family ofkernels in two-sample and independence tests: we show in particular that theenergy distance most commonly employed in statistics is just one member of aparametric family of kernels, and that other choices from this family can yieldmore powerful tests.
arxiv-600-26 | Minimax Classifier for Uncertain Costs | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0406v1.pdf | author:Rui Wang, Ke Tang category:cs.LG published:2012-05-02 summary:Many studies on the cost-sensitive learning assumed that a unique cost matrixis known for a problem. However, this assumption may not hold for manyreal-world problems. For example, a classifier might need to be applied inseveral circumstances, each of which associates with a different cost matrix.Or, different human experts have different opinions about the costs for a givenproblem. Motivated by these facts, this study aims to seek the minimaxclassifier over multiple cost matrices. In summary, we theoretically provedthat, no matter how many cost matrices are involved, the minimax problem can betackled by solving a number of standard cost-sensitive problems andsub-problems that involve only two cost matrices. As a result, a generalframework for achieving minimax classifier over multiple cost matrices issuggested and justified by preliminary empirical studies.

A variety ofexamples are presented to show the versatility of the method, includinglogistic regression, negative binomial regression, nonlinear mixed-effectsmodels, and spatial models for count data. In each case, our data-augmentationstrategy leads to simple, effective methods for posterior inference that: (1)circumvent the need for analytic approximations, numerical integration, orMetropolis-Hastings; and (2) outperform other known data-augmentationstrategies, both in ease of use and in computational efficiency.

The key to achieve the required exponential speed-upis the computationally efficient construction of low-variance estimates of thegradient. We propose importance sampling based estimates, and find that theideal distribution samples a coordinate with a probability proportional to themagnitude of the corresponding gradient. We show the surprising result that inthe case of learning the coefficients of a polynomial kernel, the combinatorialstructure of the base kernels to be combined allows the implementation ofsampling from this distribution to run in $O(\log(d))$ time, making the totalcomputational cost of the method to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal solution tobe $O(\log(d)/\epsilon^2)$, thereby allowing our method to operate for verylarge values of $d$. Experiments with simulated and real data confirm that thenew algorithm is computationally more efficient than its state-of-the-artalternatives.

The algorithm iteratively computes the proximal pointof the last estimated solution projected into an affine space which itself isparallel and approaching to the feasible set. We provide convergence analysistheoretically supporting the general algorithm, and then apply it for solving$\ell_1$-minimization problems and the matrix completion problem. Theseproblems arise in many applications including machine learning, image andsignal processing. We compare our algorithm with the existing state-of-the-artalgorithms. Experimental results on solving these problems show that ouralgorithm is very efficient and competitive.

Weanalyze in this paper this popular strategy, and prove that its worst casecomplexity is exponential in the number of variables. We then oppose thispessimistic result to an (optimistic) approximate analysis: We show that anapproximate path with at most O(1/sqrt(epsilon)) linear segments can always beobtained, where every point on the path is guaranteed to be optimal up to arelative epsilon-duality gap. We complete our theoretical analysis with apractical algorithm to compute these approximate paths.

This research paperproposes an algorithm to remove the damaged or corrupted part of the image andmake it consistent with other part of the image and to segment objects behindthe glass. The damaged part is removed using total variation inpainting methodand segmentation is done using kmeans clustering, anisotropic diffusion andwatershed transformation. The final output is obtained by interpolation. Thisalgorithm can be useful to applications in which some part of the images arecorrupted due to data transmission or needs to segment objects from an imagefor further processing.

This paper presents a novel residual belief propagation (RBP)algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed for training LDA. The proposedRBP uses an informed scheduling scheme for asynchronous message passing, whichpasses fast-convergent messages with a higher priority to influence thoseslow-convergent messages at each learning iteration. Extensive empiricalstudies confirm that RBP significantly reduces the training time untilconvergence while achieves a much lower predictive perplexity than otherstate-of-the-art training algorithms for LDA, including variational Bayes (VB),collapsed Gibbs sampling (GS), loopy belief propagation (BP), and residual VB(RVB).

Theloss function approach is applied to major learning algorithms such as supportvector machine (SVM) and boosting methods. The loss function represents thepenalty of the decision function on the training samples. In the learningalgorithm, the empirical mean of the loss function is minimized to obtain theclassifier. Against a backdrop of the development of mathematical programming,nowadays learning algorithms based on loss functions are widely applied toreal-world data analysis. In addition, statistical properties of such learningalgorithms are well-understood based on a lots of theoretical works. On theother hand, the learning method using the so-called uncertainty set is used inhard-margin SVM, mini-max probability machine (MPM) and maximum margin MPM. Inthe learning algorithm, firstly, the uncertainty set is defined for each binarylabel based on the training samples. Then, the best separating hyperplanebetween the two uncertainty sets is employed as the decision function. This isregarded as an extension of the maximum-margin approach. The uncertainty setapproach has been studied as an application of robust optimization in the fieldof mathematical programming. The statistical properties of learning algorithmswith uncertainty sets have not been intensively studied. In this paper, weconsider the relation between the above two approaches. We point out that theuncertainty set is described by using the level set of the conjugate of theloss function. Based on such relation, we study statistical properties oflearning algorithms using uncertainty sets.

In this paper we describe amethod that improves on existing global optimization techniques to trackingarticulated objects. Our method improves on the state-of-the-art AnnealedParticle Filter (APF) by reusing samples across annealing layers and by usingan adaptive parametric density for diffusion. We compare the proposed methodwith APF on a scalable problem and study how the two methods scale with thedimensionality, multi-modality and the range of search. Then we performsensitivity analysis on the parameters of our algorithm and show that ittolerates a wide range of parameter settings. We also show results on trackinghuman pose from the widely-used Human Eva I dataset. Our results show that theproposed method reduces the tracking error despite using less than 50% of thecomputational resources as APF. The tracked output also shows a significantqualitative improvement over APF as demonstrated through image and videoresults.

Giannakis category:cs.IT cs.NI math.IT stat.ML published:2012-04-30 summary:Given the superposition of a low-rank matrix plus the product of a known fatcompression matrix times a sparse matrix, the goal of this paper is toestablish deterministic conditions under which exact recovery of the low-rankand sparse components becomes possible. This fundamental identifiability issuearises with traffic anomaly detection in backbone networks, and subsumescompressed sensing as well as the timely low-rank plus sparse matrix recoverytasks encountered in matrix decomposition problems. Leveraging the ability of$\ell_1$- and nuclear norms to recover sparse and low-rank matrices, a convexprogram is formulated to estimate the unknowns. Analysis and simulationsconfirm that the said convex program can recover the unknowns for sufficientlylow-rank and sparse enough components, along with a compression matrixpossessing an isometry property when restricted to operate on sparse vectors.When the low-rank, sparse, and compression matrices are drawn from certainrandom ensembles, it is established that exact recovery is possible with highprobability. First-order algorithms are developed to solve the nonsmooth convexoptimization problem with provable iteration complexity guarantees. Insightfultests with synthetic and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of thenovel approach in unveiling traffic anomalies across flows and time, and itsability to outperform existing alternatives.

F. Moura, H. Vincent Poor category:stat.ML cs.LG cs.MA math.OC math.PR published:2012-04-30 summary:The paper considers a class of multi-agent Markov decision processes (MDPs),in which the network agents respond differently (as manifested by theinstantaneous one-stage random costs) to a global controlled state and thecontrol actions of a remote controller. The paper investigates a distributedreinforcement learning setup with no prior information on the global statetransition and local agent cost statistics. Specifically, with the agents'objective consisting of minimizing a network-averaged infinite horizondiscounted cost, the paper proposes a distributed version of $Q$-learning,$\mathcal{QD}$-learning, in which the network agents collaborate by means oflocal processing and mutual information exchange over a sparse (possiblystochastic) communication network to achieve the network goal. Under theassumption that each agent is only aware of its local online cost data and theinter-agent communication network is \emph{weakly} connected, the proposeddistributed scheme is almost surely (a.s.) shown to yield asymptotically thedesired value function and the optimal stationary control policy at eachnetwork agent. The analytical techniques developed in the paper to address themixed time-scale stochastic dynamics of the \emph{consensus + innovations}form, which arise as a result of the proposed interactive distributed scheme,are of independent interest.
arxiv-600-38 | A Singly-Exponential Time Algorithm for Computing Nonnegative Rank | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0044v1.pdf | author:Ankur Moitra category:cs.DS cs.IR cs.LG published:2012-04-30 summary:Here, we give an algorithm for deciding if the nonnegative rank of a matrix$M$ of dimension $m \times n$ is at most $r$ which runs in time$(nm)^{O(r^2)}$. This is the first exact algorithm that runs in timesingly-exponential in $r$. This algorithm (and earlier algorithms) are built onmethods for finding a solution to a system of polynomial inequalities (if oneexists). Notably, the best algorithms for this task run in time exponential inthe number of variables but polynomial in all of the other parameters (thenumber of inequalities and the maximum degree). Hence these algorithms motivate natural algebraic questions whose solutionhave immediate {\em algorithmic} implications: How many variables do we need torepresent the decision problem, does $M$ have nonnegative rank at most $r$? Anaive formulation uses $nr + mr$ variables and yields an algorithm that isexponential in $n$ and $m$ even for constant $r$. (Arora, Ge, Kannan, Moitra,STOC 2012) recently reduced the number of variables to $2r^2 2^r$, and here weexponentially reduce the number of variables to $2r^2$ and this yields our mainalgorithm. In fact, the algorithm that we obtain is nearly-optimal (under theExponential Time Hypothesis) since an algorithm that runs in time $(nm)^{o(r)}$would yield a subexponential algorithm for 3-SAT . Our main result is based on establishing a normal form for nonnegative matrixfactorization - which in turn allows us to exploit algebraic dependence among alarge collection of linear transformations with variable entries. Additionally,we also demonstrate that nonnegative rank cannot be certified by even a verylarge submatrix of $M$, and this property also follows from the intuitiongained from viewing nonnegative rank through the lens of systems of polynomialinequalities.
arxiv-600-39 | A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6703v4.pdf | author:Animashree Anandkumar, Dean P. Foster, Daniel Hsu, Sham M. Kakade, Yi-Kai Liu category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-04-30 summary:The problem of topic modeling can be seen as a generalization of theclustering problem, in that it posits that observations are generated due tomultiple latent factors (e.g., the words in each document are generated as amixture of several active topics, as opposed to just one). This increasedrepresentational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervisedlearning problem of estimating the topic probability vectors (the distributionsover words for each topic), when only the words are observed and thecorresponding topics are hidden. We provide a simple and efficient learning procedure that is guaranteed torecover the parameters for a wide class of mixture models, including thepopular latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. For LDA, the procedurecorrectly recovers both the topic probability vectors and the prior over thetopics, using only trigram statistics (i.e., third order moments, which may beestimated with documents containing just three words). The method, termedExcess Correlation Analysis (ECA), is based on a spectral decomposition of loworder moments (third and fourth order) via two singular value decompositions(SVDs). Moreover, the algorithm is scalable since the SVD operations arecarried out on $k\times k$ matrices, where $k$ is the number of latent factors(e.g. the number of topics), rather than in the $d$-dimensional observed space(typically $d \gg k$).

We assume (a) p is much large than n, (b) the coefficient vector betais sparse in the sense that only a small fraction of its coordinates isnonzero, and (c) the Gram matrix G = X'X is sparse in the sense that each rowhas relatively few large coordinates (diagonals of G are normalized to 1). The sparsity in G naturally induces the sparsity of the so-called graph ofstrong dependence (GOSD). We find an interesting interplay between the signalsparsity and the graph sparsity, which ensures that in a broad context, the setof true signals decompose into many different small-size components of GOSD,where different components are disconnected. We propose Graphlet Screening (GS) as a new approach to variable selection,which is a two-stage Screen and Clean method. The key methodological innovationof GS is to use GOSD to guide both the screening and cleaning. Compared tom-variate brute-forth screening that has a computational cost of p^m, the GSonly has a computational cost of p (up to some multi-log(p) factors) inscreening. We measure the performance of any variable selection procedure by the minimaxHamming distance. We show that in a very broad class of situations, GS achievesthe optimal rate of convergence in terms of the Hamming distance. Somewhatsurprisingly, the well-known procedures subset selection and the lasso are ratenon-optimal, even in very simple settings and even when their tuning parametersare ideally set.
arxiv-600-42 | Active Contour with A Tangential Component | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6458v1.pdf | author:Junyan Wang, Kap Luk Chan category:cs.CV published:2012-04-29 summary:Conventional edge-based active contours often require the normal component ofan edge indicator function on the optimal contours to approximate zero, whilethe tangential component can still be significant. In real images, the fullgradients of the edge indicator function along the object boundaries are oftensmall. Hence, the curve evolution of edge-based active contours can terminateearly before converging to the object boundaries with a careless contourinitialization. We propose a novel Geodesic Snakes (GeoSnakes) active contourthat requires the full gradients of the edge indicator to vanish at the optimalsolution. Besides, the conventional curve evolution approach for minimizingactive contour energy cannot fully solve the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation ofour GeoSnakes active contour, causing a Pseudo Stationary Phenomenon (PSP). Toaddress the PSP problem, we propose an auxiliary curve evolution equation,named the equilibrium flow (EF) equation. Based on the EF and the conventionalcurve evolution, we obtain a solution to the full EL equation of GeoSnakesactive contour. Experimental results validate the proposed geometricalinterpretation of the early termination problem, and they also show that theproposed method overcomes the problem.

It seems both appealing and relatively easy. Among such kind ofstudies, electoral prediction is maybe the most attractive, and at this momentthere is a growing body of literature on such a topic. This is not only aninteresting research problem but, above all, it is extremely difficult.However, most of the authors seem to be more interested in claiming positiveresults than in providing sound and reproducible methods. It is also especiallyworrisome that many recent papers seem to only acknowledge those studiessupporting the idea of Twitter predicting elections, instead of conducting abalanced literature review showing both sides of the matter. After reading manyof such papers I have decided to write such a survey myself. Hence, in thispaper, every study relevant to the matter of electoral prediction using socialmedia is commented. From this review it can be concluded that the predictivepower of Twitter regarding elections has been greatly exaggerated, and thathard research problems still lie ahead.

Barbosa category:nlin.CG cs.NE published:2012-04-27 summary:Given two subsets A and B of nodes in a directed graph, the conduciveness ofthe graph from A to B is the ratio representing how many of the edges outgoingfrom nodes in A are incoming to nodes in B. When the graph's nodes stand forthe possible solutions to certain problems of combinatorial optimization,choosing its edges appropriately has been shown to lead to conducivenessproperties that provide useful insight into the performance of algorithms tosolve those problems. Here we study the conduciveness of CA-rule graphs, thatis, graphs whose node set is the set of all CA rules given a cell's number ofpossible states and neighborhood size. We consider several different edge setsinterconnecting these nodes, both deterministic and random ones, and deriveanalytical expressions for the resulting graph's conduciveness toward ruleshaving a fixed number of non-quiescent entries. We demonstrate that one of therandom edge sets, characterized by allowing nodes to be sparsely interconnectedacross any Hamming distance between the corresponding rules, has the potentialof providing reasonable conduciveness toward the desired rules. We conjecturethat this may lie at the bottom of the best strategies known to date fordiscovering complex rules to solve specific problems, all of an evolutionarynature.

In our approach, an image region centeredon a pixel is mod-eled using the local self-similarity descriptor. We aim atobtaining a reliable change detection based on local shape change in an imagewhen foreground objects are moving. The method first builds a background modeland compares the local self-similarities between the background model and thesubsequent frames to distinguish background and foreground objects.Post-processing is then used to refine the boundaries of moving objects.Results show that this approach is promising as the foregrounds obtained arecom-plete, although they often include shadows.

Chac√≥n, Tarn Duong category:math.ST stat.ME stat.ML stat.TH 62G05, 62H30 published:2012-04-27 summary:Important information concerning a multivariate data set, such as clustersand modal regions, is contained in the derivatives of the probability densityfunction. Despite this importance, nonparametric estimation of higher orderderivatives of the density functions have received only relatively scantattention. Kernel estimators of density functions are widely used as theyexhibit excellent theoretical and practical properties, though theirgeneralization to density derivatives has progressed more slowly due to themathematical intractabilities encountered in the crucial problem of bandwidth(or smoothing parameter) selection. This paper presents the first fullyautomatic, data-based bandwidth selectors for multivariate kernel densityderivative estimators. This is achieved by synthesizing recent advances inmatrix analytic theory which allow mathematically and computationally tractablerepresentations of higher order derivatives of multivariate vector valuedfunctions. The theoretical asymptotic properties as well as the finite samplebehaviour of the proposed selectors are studied. {In addition, we explore indetail the applications of the new data-driven methods for two otherstatistical problems: clustering and bump hunting. The introduced techniquesare combined with the mean shift algorithm to develop novel automatic,nonparametric clustering procedures which are shown to outperform mixture-modelcluster analysis and other recent nonparametric approaches in practice.Furthermore, the advantage of the use of smoothing parameters designed fordensity derivative estimation for feature significance analysis for bumphunting is illustrated with a real data example.

Ravi category:cs.DS cs.LG published:2012-04-26 summary:We consider packing LP's with $m$ rows where all constraint coefficients arenormalized to be in the unit interval. The n columns arrive in random order andthe goal is to set the corresponding decision variables irrevocably when theyarrive so as to obtain a feasible solution maximizing the expected reward.Previous (1 - \epsilon)-competitive algorithms require the right-hand side ofthe LP to be Omega((m/\epsilon^2) log (n/\epsilon)), a bound that worsens withthe number of columns and rows. However, the dependence on the number ofcolumns is not required in the single-row case and known lower bounds for thegeneral case are also independent of n. Our goal is to understand whether the dependence on n is required in themulti-row case, making it fundamentally harder than the single-row version. Werefute this by exhibiting an algorithm which is (1 - \epsilon)-competitive aslong as the right-hand sides are Omega((m^2/\epsilon^2) log (m/\epsilon)). Ourtechniques refine previous PAC-learning based approaches which interpret theonline decisions as linear classifications of the columns based on sampled dualprices. The key ingredient of our improvement comes from a non-standardcovering argument together with the realization that only when the columns ofthe LP belong to few 1-d subspaces we can obtain small such covers; boundingthe size of the cover constructed also relies on the geometry of linearclassifiers. General packing LP's are handled by perturbing the input columns,which can be seen as making the learning problem more robust.

Many applications, though, providecontexts with quantitative information, telling not just whether an objectsatisfies an attribute, but also quantifying this satisfaction. Contexts inthis form arise as rating matrices in recommender systems, as occurrencematrices in text analysis, as pixel intensity matrices in digital imageprocessing, etc. Such applications have attracted a lot of attention, andseveral numeric extensions of FCA have been proposed. We propose the frameworkof proximity sets (proxets), which subsume partially ordered sets (posets) aswell as metric spaces. One feature of this approach is that it extracts fromquantified contexts quantified concepts, and thus allows full use of theavailable information. Another feature is that the categorical approach allowsanalyzing any universal properties that the classical FCA and the new versionsmay have, and thus provides structural guidance for aligning and combining theapproaches.

To help fillthis critical void, we introduced the GraphLab abstraction which naturallyexpresses asynchronous, dynamic, graph-parallel computation while ensuring dataconsistency and achieving a high degree of parallel performance in theshared-memory setting. In this paper, we extend the GraphLab framework to thesubstantially more challenging distributed setting while preserving strong dataconsistency guarantees. We develop graph based extensions to pipelined lockingand data versioning to reduce network congestion and mitigate the effect ofnetwork latency. We also introduce fault tolerance to the GraphLab abstractionusing the classic Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm and demonstrate how it canbe easily implemented by exploiting the GraphLab abstraction itself. Finally,we evaluate our distributed implementation of the GraphLab abstraction on alarge Amazon EC2 deployment and show 1-2 orders of magnitude performance gainsover Hadoop-based implementations.

The bigger the dictionary is, the higher isthe error detection rate. The fact that spell checkers are based on regulardictionaries, they suffer from data sparseness problem as they cannot capturelarge vocabulary of words including proper names, domain-specific terms,technical jargons, special acronyms, and terminologies. As a result, theyexhibit low error detection rate and often fail to catch major errors in thetext. This paper proposes a new context-sensitive spelling correction methodfor detecting and correcting non-word and real-word errors in digital textdocuments. The approach hinges around data statistics from Google Web 1T 5-gramdata set which consists of a big volume of n-gram word sequences, extractedfrom the World Wide Web. Fundamentally, the proposed method comprises an errordetector that detects misspellings, a candidate spellings generator based on acharacter 2-gram model that generates correction suggestions, and an errorcorrector that performs contextual error correction. Experiments conducted on aset of text documents from different domains and containing misspellings,showed an outstanding spelling error correction rate and a drastic reduction ofboth non-word and real-word errors. In a further study, the proposed algorithmis to be parallelized so as to lower the computational cost of the errordetection and correction processes.
arxiv-600-55 | Regret Analysis of Stochastic and Nonstochastic Multi-armed Bandit Problems | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.5721v2.pdf | author:S√©bastien Bubeck, Nicol√≤ Cesa-Bianchi category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-04-25 summary:Multi-armed bandit problems are the most basic examples of sequentialdecision problems with an exploration-exploitation trade-off. This is thebalance between staying with the option that gave highest payoffs in the pastand exploring new options that might give higher payoffs in the future.Although the study of bandit problems dates back to the Thirties,exploration-exploitation trade-offs arise in several modern applications, suchas ad placement, website optimization, and packet routing. Mathematically, amulti-armed bandit is defined by the payoff process associated with eachoption. In this survey, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis ofregret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoffs and adversarialpayoffs. Besides the basic setting of finitely many actions, we also analyzesome of the most important variants and extensions, such as the contextualbandit model.

Srikant, Jian Ni category:stat.ML published:2012-04-25 summary:We consider the structure learning problem for graphical models that we callloosely connected Markov random fields, in which the number of short pathsbetween any pair of nodes is small, and present a new conditional independencetest based algorithm for learning the underlying graph structure. The novelmaximization step in our algorithm ensures that the true edges are detectedcorrectly even when there are short cycles in the graph. The number of samplesrequired by our algorithm is C*log p, where p is the size of the graph and theconstant C depends on the parameters of the model. We show that severalpreviously studied models are examples of loosely connected Markov randomfields, and our algorithm achieves the same or lower computational complexitythan the previously designed algorithms for individual cases. We also get newresults for more general graphical models, in particular, our algorithm learnsgeneral Ising models on the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(p, c/p) correctly withrunning time O(np^5).

Stevens, Andrew Adamatzky, Ishrat Jahan, Ben de Lacy Costello category:nlin.PS cs.CL published:2012-04-24 summary:We demonstrate an improved technique for implementing logic circuits inlight-sensitive chemical excitable media. The technique makes use of theconstant-speed propagation of waves along defined channels in an excitablemedium based on the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, along with the mutualannihilation of colliding waves. What distinguishes this work from previouswork in this area is that regions where channels meet at a junction canperiodically alternate between permitting the propagation of waves and blockingthem. These valve-like areas are used to select waves based on the length oftime that it takes waves to propagate from one valve to another. In anexperimental implementation, the channels which make up the circuit layout areprojected by a digital projector connected to a computer. Excitable channelsare projected as dark areas, unexcitable regions as light areas. Valvesalternate between dark and light: every valve has the same period and phase,with a 50% duty cycle. This scheme can be used to make logic gates based oncombinations of OR and AND-NOT operations, with few geometrical constraints.Because there are few geometrical constraints, compact circuits can beimplemented. Experimental results from an implementation of a 4-bit input,2-bit output integer square root circuit are given. This is the most complexlogic circuit that has been implemented in BZ excitable media to date.

In this paper we introduce a new type of lexical ontology calledinterlingual lexical ontology (ILexicOn), which uses semantic web formalisms tomake each interlingual lexical unit class (ILUc) support the projection of itssemantic decomposition on itself. After a short overview of existing lexicalontologies, we briefly introduce the semantic web formalisms we use. We thenpresent the three layered architecture of our approach: i) the interlinguallexical meta-ontology (ILexiMOn); ii) the ILexicOn where ILUcs are formallydefined; iii) the data layer. We illustrate our approach with a standaloneILexicOn, and introduce and explain a concise human-readable notation torepresent ILexicOns. Finally, we show how semantic web formalisms enable theprojection of a semantic decomposition on the decomposed ILUc.

Sincethe performance of the face recognition systems is greatly affected by theposes of the face, how to estimate the accurate pose of the face in human faceimage is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we represent a novelmethod for head pose estimation. To enhance the efficiency of the estimation weuse contourlet transform for feature extraction. Contourlet transform ismulti-resolution, multi-direction transform. In order to reduce the featurespace dimension and obtain appropriate features we use LDA (Linear DiscriminantAnalysis) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to remove ineffcient features.Then, we apply different classifiers such as k-nearest neighborhood (knn) andminimum distance. We use the public available FERET database to evaluate theperformance of proposed method. Simulation results indicate the superiorrobustness of the proposed method.

Thesynthesis model, which assumes that images can be decomposed into a linearcombination of very few atoms of some dictionary, is now a well establishedtool for the design of image reconstruction algorithms. An interestingalternative is the analysis model, where the signal is multiplied by ananalysis operator and the outcome is assumed to be the sparse. This approachhas only recently gained increasing interest. The quality of reconstructionmethods based on an analysis model severely depends on the right choice of thesuitable operator. In this work, we present an algorithm for learning an analysis operator fromtraining images. Our method is based on an $\ell_p$-norm minimization on theset of full rank matrices with normalized columns. We carefully introduce theemployed conjugate gradient method on manifolds, and explain the underlyinggeometry of the constraints. Moreover, we compare our approach tostate-of-the-art methods for image denoising, inpainting, and single imagesuper-resolution. Our numerical results show competitive performance of ourgeneral approach in all presented applications compared to the specializedstate-of-the-art techniques.

One approach to solve this kind of problem isto use an informed search strategy. The principle of this kind of strategy isto use problem-specific knowledge beyond the definition of the problem itselfto find solutions more efficiently than with an uninformed strategy. This kindof strategy demands to define problem-specific knowledge (heuristics). Theefficiency and the effectiveness of systems based on it directly depend on theused knowledge quality. Unfortunately, acquiring and maintaining such knowledgecan be fastidious.

In this work we propose a multiscale framework forcoping with the NP-hardness of discrete optimization. Our approach utilizesalgebraic multiscale principles to efficiently explore the discrete solutionspace, yielding improved results on challenging, non-submodular energies forwhich current methods provide unsatisfactory approximations. In contrast topopular multiscale methods in computer vision, that builds an image pyramid,our framework acts directly on the energy to construct an energy pyramid.Deriving a multiscale scheme from the energy itself makes our frameworkapplication independent and widely applicable. Our framework gives rise to twocomplementary energy coarsening strategies: one in which coarser scales involvefewer variables, and a more revolutionary one in which the coarser scalesinvolve fewer discrete labels. We empirically evaluated our unified frameworkon a variety of both non-submodular and submodular energies, including energiesfrom Middlebury benchmark.

Furthermore, EHRs are increasingly likely toinclude data relating to patient outcomes, functionality such as clinicaldecision support, and genetic information as well, and, as such, can be seen asrepositories of increasingly valuable information about patients' healthconditions and responses to treatment over time. Methods: We describe a casestudy of 423 patients treated by Centerstone within Tennessee and Indiana inwhich we utilized electronic health record data to generate predictivealgorithms of individual patient treatment response. Multiple models wereconstructed using predictor variables derived from clinical, financial andgeographic data. Results: For the 423 patients, 101 deteriorated, 223 improvedand in 99 there was no change in clinical condition. Based on modeling ofvarious clinical indicators at baseline, the highest accuracy in predictingindividual patient response ranged from 70-72% within the models tested. Interms of individual predictors, the Centerstone Assessment of Recovery Level -Adult (CARLA) baseline score was most significant in predicting outcome overtime (odds ratio 4.1 + 2.27). Other variables with consistently significantimpact on outcome included payer, diagnostic category, location and provisionof case management services. Conclusions: This approach represents a promisingavenue toward reducing the current gap between research and practice acrosshealthcare, developing data-driven clinical decision support based onreal-world populations, and serving as a component of embedded clinicalartificial intelligences that "learn" over time.

Our modelshows how 'interference of concepts' explains the effects of underextension andoverextension when two concepts combine to the disjunction of these twoconcepts. This result supports our earlier hypothesis that human thought has asuperposed two-layered structure, one layer consisting of 'classical logicalthought' and a superposed layer consisting of 'quantum conceptual thought'.Possible connections with recent findings of a 'grid-structure' for the brainare analyzed, and influences on the mind/brain relation, and consequences onapplied disciplines, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computation,are considered.

Hruschka, Joydeep Ghosh, Sreangsu Acharyya category:cs.LG published:2012-04-20 summary:Unsupervised models can provide supplementary soft constraints to helpclassify new, "target" data since similar instances in the target set are morelikely to share the same class label. Such models can also help detect possibledifferences between training and target distributions, which is useful inapplications where concept drift may take place, as in transfer learningsettings. This paper describes a general optimization framework that takes asinput class membership estimates from existing classifiers learnt on previouslyencountered "source" data, as well as a similarity matrix from a clusterensemble operating solely on the target data to be classified, and yields aconsensus labeling of the target data. This framework admits a wide range ofloss functions and classification/clustering methods. It exploits properties ofBregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre duality to yield a principledand scalable approach. A variety of experiments show that the proposedframework can yield results substantially superior to those provided by populartransductive learning techniques or by naively applying classifiers learnt onthe original task to the target data.

In this context, it is ofmuch interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components;by exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the predictionperformance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization orpenalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed,but they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically requiresolving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs.In this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select asparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclicgraph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAGcalled "path coding" penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions thatmodel long-range interactions between features in a graph, path codingpenalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involvepath selection problems, which we efficiently solve by leveraging network flowoptimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data thatour approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than otherregularization functions for graphs.

The regret of thedecision maker is the difference between her realized loss and the best lossshe would have achieved by picking, in hindsight, the best possible action. Ourgoal is to understand the magnitude of the best possible (minimax) regret. Westudy the problem under three different assumptions for the feedback thedecision maker receives: full information, and the partial information modelsof the so-called "semi-bandit" and "bandit" problems. Combining the MirrorDescent algorithm and the INF (Implicitely Normalized Forecaster) strategy, weare able to prove optimal bounds for the semi-bandit case. We also recover theoptimal bounds for the full information setting. In the bandit case we discussexisting results in light of a new lower bound, and suggest a conjecture on theoptimal regret in that case. Finally we also prove that the standardexponentially weighted average forecaster is provably suboptimal in the settingof online combinatorial optimization.

This paper concerns the system identification of a hybrid systemmodel of a building-wide HVAC system and its subsequent control using a hybridsystem formulation of learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC). Here,the learning refers to model updates to the hybrid system model thatincorporate the heating effects due to occupancy, solar effects, outside airtemperature (OAT), and equipment, in addition to integrator dynamics inherentlypresent in low-level control. Though we make significant modelingsimplifications, our corresponding controller that uses this model is able toexperimentally achieve a large reduction in energy usage without anydegradations in occupant comfort. It is in this way that we justify themodeling simplifications that we have made. We conclude by presenting resultsfrom experiments on our building HVAC testbed, which show an average of 1.5MWhof energy savings per day (p = 0.002) with a 95% confidence interval of 1.0MWhto 2.1MWh of energy savings.

A popular strategy is based on tree-based imagerepresentations: for example, one can compute an attribute on each node of thetree and keep only the nodes for which the attribute is sufficiently strong.This operation can be seen as a thresholding of the tree, seen as a graph whosenodes are weighted by the attribute. Rather than being satisfied with a merethresholding, we propose to expand on this idea, and to apply connected filterson this latest graph. Consequently, the filtering is done not in the space ofthe image, but on the space of shapes build from the image. Such a processingis a generalization of the existing tree-based connected operators. Indeed, theframework includes classical existing connected operators by attributes. Italso allows us to propose a class of novel connected operators from theleveling family, based on shape attributes. Finally, we also propose a novelclass of self-dual connected operators that we call morphological shapings.

Jordan category:stat.ML published:2012-04-19 summary:In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction ofsparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we define such priors as a mixture ofexponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density(EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and thespecial cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures.Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework forsparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can beexplicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution alsofollows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. These properties lead usto EM algorithms for Bayesian sparse learning. We show that these algorithmsbear an interesting resemblance to iteratively re-weighted $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$methods. In addition, we present two extensions for grouped variable selectionand logistic regression.

Jain, Klaus Obermayer category:cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV published:2012-04-19 summary:Learning in Riemannian orbifolds is motivated by existing machine learningalgorithms that directly operate on finite combinatorial structures such aspoint patterns, trees, and graphs. These methods, however, lack statisticaljustification. This contribution derives consistency results for learningproblems in structured domains and thereby generalizes learning in vectorspaces and manifolds.
arxiv-600-85 | Estimating Unknown Sparsity in Compressed Sensing | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.4227v2.pdf | author:Miles E. Lopes category:cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.ME stat.ML stat.TH published:2012-04-19 summary:In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity x_0 of the unknownsignal x\in\R^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it istypically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS dependon knowing x_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-drivenway. A second practical concern is that x_0 is a highly unstable functionof x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, thevalue x_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number ofcoordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsitys(x):=x_1^2/x_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on x_0. Ourestimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does notrely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation. Aconfidence interval for s(x) is provided, and its width is shown to have nodependence on the signal dimension p. Moreover, this result extends naturallyto the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can beestimated with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use ofrandomized measurements is essential to estimating s(x). This is accomplishedby proving that the minimax risk for estimating s(x) with deterministicmeasurements is large when n<<p.

However, an issue that still deserves more study concerns the automaticevaluation of generalised data. Indeed, many automated generalisation systemsrequire the utilisation of an evaluation function to automatically assessgeneralisation outcomes. In this paper, we propose a new approach dedicated tothe design of such a function. This approach allows an imperfectly definedevaluation function to be revised through a man-machine dialogue. The usergives its preferences to the system by comparing generalisation outcomes.Machine Learning techniques are then used to improve the evaluation function.An experiment carried out on buildings shows that our approach significantlyimproves generalisation evaluation functions defined by users.

Indeed, manyworks propose to learn new knowledge from examples that translate the expectedbehaviour of the considered system. A key issue of supervised learning concernsthe description language used to represent the examples. In this paper, wepropose a method to evaluate the feature set used to describe them.

We carriedout a case study in the domain of geomatic in order to evaluate the sets ofmeasures used to characterise geographic objects. The case study shows that ourmethod allows to give relevant evaluations of measure sets.

We investigate thephenomenon of fame by mining a collection of news articles that spans thetwentieth century, and also perform a side study on a collection of blog postsfrom the last 10 years. By analyzing mentions of personal names, we measureeach person's time in the spotlight, using two simple metrics that evaluate,roughly, the duration of a single news story about a person, and the overallduration of public interest in a person. We watched the distribution evolvefrom 1895 to 2010, expecting to find significantly shortening fame durations,per the much popularly bemoaned shortening of society's attention spans andquickening of media's news cycles. Instead, we conclusively demonstrate that,through many decades of rapid technological and societal change, through theappearance of Twitter, communication satellites, and the Internet, famedurations did not decrease, neither for the typical case nor for the extremelyfamous, with the last statistically significant fame duration decreases comingin the early 20th century, perhaps from the spread of telegraphy and telephony.Furthermore, while median fame durations stayed persistently constant, for themost famous of the famous, as measured by either volume or duration of mediaattention, fame durations have actually trended gently upward since the 1940s,with statistically significant increases on 40-year timescales. Similar studieshave been done with much shorter timescales specifically in the context ofinformation spreading on Twitter and similar social networking sites. To thebest of our knowledge, this is the first massive scale study of this naturethat spans over a century of archived data, thereby allowing us to trackchanges across decades.

This class ofobjects includes dynamic textures such as steam, fire, smoke, water, etc., aswell as articulated objects such as humans performing various actions. We modelthe temporal evolution of the object's appearance/motion using a LinearDynamical System (LDS). We learn such models from sample videos and use them asdynamic templates for tracking objects in novel videos. We pose the problem oftracking a dynamic non-rigid object in the current frame as a maximuma-posteriori estimate of the location of the object and the latent state of thedynamical system, given the current image features and the best estimate of thestate in the previous frame. The advantage of our approach is that we canspecify a-priori the type of texture to be tracked in the scene by usingpreviously trained models for the dynamics of these textures. Our frameworknaturally generalizes common tracking methods such as SSD and kernel-basedtracking from static templates to dynamic templates. We test our algorithm onsynthetic as well as real examples of dynamic textures and show that our simpledynamics-based trackers perform at par if not better than the state-of-the-art.Since our approach is general and applicable to any image feature, we alsoapply it to the problem of human action tracking and build action-specificoptical flow trackers that perform better than the state-of-the-art whentracking a human performing a particular action. Finally, since our approach isgenerative, we can use a-priori trained trackers for different texture oraction classes to simultaneously track and recognize the texture or action inthe video.

In the standard supervised learning, only the labeled data isobserved. The classification and regression problems are formalized as thesupervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled data is alsoobtained in addition to labeled data. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data isimportant to improve the prediction accuracy in semi-supervised learning. Thisproblems is regarded as a semiparametric estimation problem with missing data.Under the the discriminative probabilistic models, it had been considered thatthe unlabeled data is useless to improve the estimation accuracy. Recently, itwas revealed that the weighted estimator using the unlabeled data achievesbetter prediction accuracy in comparison to the learning method using onlylabeled data, especially when the discriminative probabilistic model ismisspecified. That is, the improvement under the semiparametric model withmissing data is possible, when the semiparametric model is misspecified. Inthis paper, we apply the density-ratio estimator to obtain the weight functionin the semi-supervised learning. The benefit of our approach is that theproposed estimator does not require well-specified probabilistic models for theprobability of the unlabeled data. Based on the statistical asymptotic theory,we prove that the estimation accuracy of our method outperforms the supervisedlearning using only labeled data. Some numerical experiments present theusefulness of our methods.

ConvNets are hierarchical feature learning neural networkswhose structure is biologically inspired. Unlike many popular vision approachesthat are hand-designed, ConvNets can automatically learn a unique set offeatures optimized for a given task. We augmented the traditional ConvNetarchitecture by learning multi-stage features and by using Lp pooling andestablish a new state-of-the-art of 94.85% accuracy on the SVHN dataset (45.2%error improvement). Furthermore, we analyze the benefits of different poolingmethods and multi-stage features in ConvNets. The source code and a tutorialare available at eblearn.sf.net.

We first consider the question of learnability for statistical learningproblems in the general learning setting. The question of learnability is wellstudied and fully characterized for binary classification and for real valuedsupervised learning problems using the theory of uniform convergence. Howeverwe show that for the general learning setting uniform convergence theory failsto characterize learnability. To fill this void we use stability of learningalgorithms to fully characterize statistical learnability in the generalsetting. Next we consider the problem of online learning. Unlike thestatistical learning framework there is a dearth of generic tools that can beused to establish learnability and rates for online learning problems ingeneral. We provide online analogs to classical tools from statistical learningtheory like Rademacher complexity, covering numbers, etc. We further use thesetools to fully characterize learnability for online supervised learningproblems. II. In the second part, for general classes of convex learning problems, weprovide appropriate mirror descent (MD) updates for online and statisticallearning of these problems. Further, we show that the the MD is near optimalfor online convex learning and for most cases, is also near optimal forstatistical convex learning. We next consider the problem of convexoptimization and show that oracle complexity can be lower bounded by the socalled fat-shattering dimension of the associated linear class. Thus weestablish a strong connection between offline convex optimization problems andstatistical learning problems. We also show that for a large class of highdimensional optimization problems, MD is in fact near optimal even for convexoptimization.

It involves anumber of trained market participants that bet on the possible outcomes and arerewarded if they predict correctly. This paper generalizes the scope of theArtificial Prediction Markets to regression, where there are uncountably manypossible outcomes and the error is usually the MSE. For that, we introduce thereward kernel that rewards each participant based on its prediction error andwe derive the price equations. Using two reward kernels we obtain two differentlearning rules, one of which is approximated using Hermite-Gauss quadrature.The market setting makes it easy to aggregate specialized regressors that onlypredict when an observation falls into their specialization domain. Experimentsshow that regression markets based on the two learning rules outperform RandomForest Regression on many UCI datasets and are rarely outperformed.

arxiv-600-95 | Message passing with relaxed moment matching | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.4166v2.pdf | author:Yuan Qi, Yandong Guo category:cs.LG stat.CO stat.ML published:2012-04-18 summary:Bayesian learning is often hampered by large computational expense. As apowerful generalization of popular belief propagation, expectation propagation(EP) efficiently approximates the exact Bayesian computation. Nevertheless, EPcan be sensitive to outliers and suffer from divergence for difficult cases. Toaddress this issue, we propose a new approximate inference approach, relaxedexpectation propagation (REP). It relaxes the moment matching requirement ofexpectation propagation by adding a relaxation factor into the KL minimization.We penalize this relaxation with a $l_1$ penalty. As a result, when twodistributions in the relaxed KL divergence are similar, the relaxation factorwill be penalized to zero and, therefore, we obtain the original momentmatching; In the presence of outliers, these two distributions aresignificantly different and the relaxation factor will be used to reduce thecontribution of the outlier. Based on this penalized KL minimization, REP isrobust to outliers and can greatly improve the posterior approximation qualityover EP. To examine the effectiveness of REP, we apply it to Gaussian processclassification, a task known to be suitable to EP. Our classification resultson synthetic and UCI benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement ofREP over EP and Power EP--in terms of algorithmic stability, estimationaccuracy and predictive performance.

Preen, Larry Bull category:cs.NE cs.CG published:2012-04-18 summary:We have recently presented an initial study of evolutionary algorithms usedto design vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) wherein candidate prototypes areevaluated under approximated wind tunnel conditions after being physicallyinstantiated by a 3D printer. That is, unlike other approaches such ascomputational fluid dynamics simulations, no mathematical formulations are usedand no model assumptions are made. However, the representation usedsignificantly restricted the range of morphologies explored. In this paper, wepresent initial explorations into the use of a simple generative encoding,known as Gielis superformula, that produces a highly flexible 3D shaperepresentation to design VAWT. First, the target-based evolution of 3Dartefacts is investigated and subsequently initial design experiments areperformed wherein each VAWT candidate is physically instantiated and evaluatedunder approximated wind tunnel conditions. It is shown possible to produce veryclosely matching designs of a number of 3D objects through the evolution ofsupershapes produced by Gielis superformula. Moreover, it is shown possible touse artificial physical evolution to identify novel and increasingly efficientsupershape VAWT designs.

In this paper, wepropose a sparse Gaussian process model, EigenGP, based on the Karhunen-Loeve(KL) expansion of a GP prior. We use the Nystrom approximation to obtain datadependent eigenfunctions and select these eigenfunctions by evidencemaximization. This selection reduces the number of eigenfunctions in our modeland provides a nonstationary covariance function. To handle nonlinearlikelihoods, we develop an efficient expectation propagation (EP) inferencealgorithm, and couple it with expectation maximization for eigenfunctionselection. Because the eigenfunctions of a Gaussian kernel are associated withclusters of samples - including both the labeled and unlabeled - selectingrelevant eigenfunctions enables EigenGP to conduct semi-supervised learning.Our experimental results demonstrate improved predictive performance of EigenGPover alternative state-of-the-art sparse GP and semisupervised learning methodsfor regression, classification, and semisupervised classification.

We propose and evaluatean approach that substantially shrinks the stream of tweets in real-time, andconsists of two steps: (i) sub-event detection, which determines if somethingnew has occurred, and (ii) tweet selection, which picks a representative tweetto describe each sub-event. We compare the summaries generated in threelanguages for all the soccer games in "Copa America 2011" to reference livereports offered by Yahoo! Sports journalists. We show that simple text analysismethods which do not involve external knowledge lead to summaries that cover84% of the sub-events on average, and 100% of key types of sub-events (such asgoals in soccer). Our approach should be straightforwardly applicable to otherkinds of scheduled events such as other sports, award ceremonies, keynotetalks, TV shows, etc.

Our approach views the processing within and collaboration betweenreceivers as the solution to an inference problem in the probabilistic model ofthe whole system. The probabilistic model is formulated to explicitlyincorporate the receivers' ability to share information of a predefined type.We employ a recently proposed unified message-passing tool to infer thevariables of interest in the factor graph representation of the probabilisticmodel. The exchange of information between receivers arises in the form ofpassing messages along some specific edges of the factor graph; the rate ofupdating and passing these messages determines the communication overheadassociated with cooperation. Simulation results illustrate the high performanceof the proposed algorithm even with a low number of message exchanges betweenreceivers.

The paper analyses the stages in theevolution of early writing systems which began with the evolution of countingin the ancient Near East. A stage anterior to the stage of syllabicrepresentation of sounds of a language, is identified. Unique geometric shapesrequired for tokens to categorize objects became too large to handle toabstract hundreds of categories of goods and metallurgical processes during theproduction of bronze-age goods. About 3500 BCE, Indus script as a writingsystem was developed to use hieroglyphs to represent the 'spoken words'identifying each of the goods and processes. A rebus method of representingsimilar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indusscript. This method is recognized and consistently applied for the linguafranca of the Indian sprachbund. That the ancient languages of India,constituted a sprachbund (or language union) is now recognized by manylinguists. The sprachbund area is proximate to the area where most of the Indusscript inscriptions were discovered, as documented in the corpora. Thathundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidencedby their use on early punch-marked coins. This explains the combined use ofsyllabic scripts such as Brahmi and Kharoshti together with the hieroglyphs onRampurva copper bolt, and Sohgaura copper plate from about 6th centuryBCE.Indian hieroglyphs constitute a writing system for meluhha language and arerebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy lexemes. The rebus principle wasemployed by the early scripts and can legitimately be used to decipher theIndus script, after secure pictorial identification.

Burjorjee category:cs.NE cs.AI I.2.8; F.2 published:2012-04-16 summary:The hyperclimbing hypothesis is a hypothetical explanation for adaptation ingenetic algorithms with uniform crossover (UGAs). Hyperclimbing is anintuitive, general-purpose, non-local search heuristic applicable to discreteproduct spaces with rugged or stochastic cost functions. The strength of thisheuristic lie in its insusceptibility to local optima when the cost function isdeterministic, and its tolerance for noise when the cost function isstochastic. Hyperclimbing works by decimating a search space, i.e. byiteratively fixing the values of small numbers of variables. The hyperclimbinghypothesis holds that UGAs work by implementing efficient hyperclimbing. Proofof concept for this hypothesis comes from the use of a novel analytic techniqueinvolving the exploitation of algorithmic symmetry. We have also obtainedexperimental results that show that a simple tweak inspired by thehyperclimbing hypothesis dramatically improves the performance of a UGA onlarge, random instances of MAX-3SAT and the Sherrington Kirkpatrick SpinGlasses problem.

A key distinguishing aspect of this work is that it labelsvideos with verbs that describe the spatiotemporal interaction between eventparticipants, humans and objects interacting with each other, abstracting awayall object-class information and fine-grained image characteristics, andrelying solely on the coarse-grained motion of the event participants. We applyour approach to a large set of 22 distinct verb classes and a corpus of 2,584videos, yielding two surprising outcomes. First, a classification accuracy ofgreater than 70% on a 1-out-of-22 labeling task and greater than 85% on avariety of 1-out-of-10 subsets of this labeling task is independent of thechoice of which of two different time-series classifiers we employ. Second, weachieve this level of accuracy using a highly impoverished intermediaterepresentation consisting solely of the bounding boxes of one or two eventparticipants as a function of time. This indicates that successful eventrecognition depends more on the choice of appropriate features thatcharacterize the linguistic invariants of the event classes than on theparticular classifier algorithms.

Phillips, Avishek Saha, Suresh Venkatasubramanian category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-04-16 summary:In distributed learning, the goal is to perform a learning task over datadistributed across multiple nodes with minimal (expensive) communication. Priorwork (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds thecommunication required for learning classifiers while allowing for $\eps$training error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed acrossnodes. In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model.Our first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocolthat uses $O(d^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of communication to classify distributeddata in arbitrary dimension $d$, $\eps$-optimally. This readily extends toclassification over $k$ nodes with $O(kd^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words ofcommunication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerablymore efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empiricalresults. In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doingefficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solvefixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in adistributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Sincemany learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems whereconstraints are generated by individual points, this models many typicaldistributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connectionfrom multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-updateframework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, ourmethods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.

We provide generalupper and lower bounds on the amount of communication needed to learn well,showing that in addition to VC-dimension and covering number, quantities suchas the teaching-dimension and mistake-bound of a class play an important role.We also present tight results for a number of common concept classes includingconjunctions, parity functions, and decision lists. For linear separators, weshow that for non-concentrated distributions, we can use a version of thePerceptron algorithm to learn with much less communication than the number ofupdates given by the usual margin bound. We also show how boosting can beperformed in a generic manner in the distributed setting to achievecommunication with only logarithmic dependence on 1/epsilon for any conceptclass, and demonstrate how recent work on agnostic learning fromclass-conditional queries can be used to achieve low communication in agnosticsettings as well. We additionally present an analysis of privacy, consideringboth differential privacy and a notion of distributional privacy that isespecially appealing in this context.

This paper is devoted to testing theassumption of exchangeability on-line: the examples arrive one by one, andafter receiving each example we would like to have a valid measure of thedegree to which the assumption of exchangeability has been falsified. Suchmeasures are provided by exchangeability martingales. We extend knowntechniques for constructing exchangeability martingales and show that our newmethod is competitive with the martingales introduced before. Finally weinvestigate the performance of our testing method on two benchmark datasets,USPS and Statlog Satellite data; for the former, the known techniques givesatisfactory results, but for the latter our new more flexible method becomesnecessary.

To addressthis problem we developed an evolutionary model of adaptive behavior in themultigoal stochastic environment. Proposed neuroevolutionary algorithm is basedon neuron's duplication as a basic mechanism of agent's recurrent neuralnetwork development. Results of simulation demonstrate that in the course ofevolution agents acquire the ability to store the short-term memory and,therefore, use it in behavioral strategies with alternative actions. We foundthat evolution discovered two mechanisms for short-term memory. The firstmechanism is integration of sensory signals and ongoing internal neuralactivity, resulting in emergence of cell groups specialized on alternativeactions. And the second mechanism is slow neurodynamical processes that makespossible to code the previous behavioral choice.

In this paper a novel approachfor compensating the distortion of any interpolation based on modular methodhas been proposed. In this method the performance of the modular method isoptimized by adding only some simply calculated coefficients. This approachcauses drastic improvement in terms of signal-to-noise ratios with fewermodules compared to the classical modular method. Simulation results clearlyconfirm the improvement of the proposed method and also its superior robustnessagainst additive noise.

To address thisproblem, we propose a visual tracker based on non-sparse linearrepresentations, which admit an efficient closed-form solution withoutsacrificing accuracy. Moreover, in order to capture the correlation informationbetween different feature dimensions, we learn a Mahalanobis distance metric inan online fashion and incorporate the learned metric into the optimizationproblem for obtaining the linear representation. We show that online metriclearning using proximity comparison significantly improves the robustness ofthe tracking, especially on those sequences exhibiting drastic appearancechanges. Furthermore, in order to prevent the unbounded growth in the number oftraining samples for the metric learning, we design a time-weighted reservoirsampling method to maintain and update limited-sized foreground and backgroundsample buffers for balancing sample diversity and adaptability. Experimentalresults on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness ofthe proposed tracker.

Since secondary users (SU) usually have no prior knowledge onthe environment, they need to learn the availability of each channel throughsensing techniques, which however can be prone to detection errors. We arguethat cooperation among secondary users can enable efficient learning andcoordination mechanisms in order to maximize the spectrum exploitation by SUs,while minimizing the impact on the primary network. To this goal, we providethree novel contributions in this paper. First, we formulate the spectrumselection in secondary networks as an instance of the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)problem, and we extend the analysis to the collaboration learning case, inwhich each SU learns the spectrum occupation, and shares this information withother SUs. We show that collaboration among SUs can mitigate the impact ofsensing errors on system performance, and improve the convergence of thelearning process to the optimal solution. Second, we integrate the learningalgorithms with two collaboration techniques based on modified versions of theHungarian algorithm and of the Round Robin algorithm that allows reducing theinterference among SUs. Third, we derive fundamental limits to the performanceof cooperative learning algorithms based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)policies in a symmetric scenario where all SU have the same perception of thequality of the resources. Extensive simulation results confirm theeffectiveness of our joint learning-collaboration algorithm in protecting theoperations of Primary Users (PUs), while maximizing the performance of SUs.

We try to address the issue of language complexity empirically bycomparing the simple English Wikipedia (Simple) to comparable samples of themain English Wikipedia (Main). Simple is supposed to use a more simplifiedlanguage with a limited vocabulary, and editors are explicitly requested tofollow this guideline, yet in practice the vocabulary richness of both samplesare at the same level. Detailed analysis of longer units (n-grams of words andpart of speech tags) shows that the language of Simple is less complex thanthat of Main primarily due to the use of shorter sentences, as opposed todrastically simplified syntax or vocabulary. Comparing the two languagevarieties by the Gunning readability index supports this conclusion. We alsoreport on the topical dependence of language complexity, e.g. that the languageis more advanced in conceptual articles compared to person-based (biographical)and object-based articles. Finally, we investigate the relation betweenconflict and language complexity by analyzing the content of the talk pagesassociated to controversial and peacefully developing articles, concluding thatcontroversy has the effect of reducing language complexity.

Doingthis requires determining which portions of the structure are occluded in thefirst place. Since each process relies on the other, we determine a solution toboth problems in tandem. We extend our framework to determine confidence ofone's assessment of which portions of an observed structure are occluded, andthe estimate of that occluded structure, by determining the sensitivity ofone's assessment to potential new observations. We further extend our frameworkto determine a robotic action whose execution would allow a new observationthat would maximally increase one's confidence.

We propose several adaptedinter-annotator agreement coefficients which use S that are suitable forsegmentation.

Starting with the flooding adjunction, we introduce theflooding graphs, for which node and edge weights may be deduced one from theother. Each node weighted or edge weighted graph may be transformed in aflooding graph, showing that there is no superiority in using one or the other,both being equivalent. We then introduce pruning operators extract subgraphs ofincreasing steepness. For an increasing steepness, the number of neverascending paths becomes smaller and smaller. This reduces the watershed zone,where catchment basins overlap. A last pruning operator called scissorassociates to each node outside the regional minima one and only one edge. Thecatchment basins of this new graph do not overlap and form a watershedpartition. Again, with an increasing steepness, the number of distinctwatershed partitions contained in a graph becomes smaller and smaller.Ultimately, for natural image, an infinite steepness leads to a uniquesolution, as it is not likely that two absolutely identical non ascending pathsof infinite steepness connect a node with two distinct minima. It happens thatnon ascending paths of a given steepness are the geodesics of lexicographicdistance functions of a given depth. This permits to extract the watershedpartitions as skeletons by zone of influence of the minima for suchlexicographic distances. The waterfall hierarchy is obtained by a sequence ofoperations. The first constructs the minimum spanning forest which spans aninitial watershed partition. The contraction of the trees into one nodeproduces a reduced graph which may be submitted to the same treatment. Theprocess is iterated until only one region remains. The union of the edges ofall forests produced constitutes a minimum spanning tree of the initial graph.
arxiv-600-126 | Stochastic Feature Mapping for PAC-Bayes Classification | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.2609v2.pdf | author:Xiong Li, Tai Sing Lee, Yuncai Liu category:cs.LG published:2012-04-12 summary:Probabilistic generative modeling of data distributions can potentiallyexploit hidden information which is useful for discriminative classification.This observation has motivated the development of approaches that couplegenerative and discriminative models for classification. In this paper, wepropose a new approach to couple generative and discriminative models in anunified framework based on PAC-Bayes risk theory. We first derive themodel-parameter-independent stochastic feature mapping from a practical MAPclassifier operating on generative models. Then we construct a linearstochastic classifier equipped with the feature mapping, and derive theexplicit PAC-Bayes risk bounds for such classifier for both supervised andsemi-supervised learning. Minimizing the risk bound, using an EM-like iterativeprocedure, results in a new posterior over hidden variables (E-step) and theupdate rules of model parameters (M-step). The derivation of the posterior isalways feasible due to the way of equipping feature mapping and the explicitform of bounding risk. The derived posterior allows the tuning of generativemodels and subsequently the feature mappings for better classification. Thederived update rules of the model parameters are same to those of the uncoupledmodels as the feature mapping is model-parameter-independent. Our experimentsshow that the coupling between data modeling generative model and thediscriminative classifier via a stochastic feature mapping in this frameworkleads to a general classification tool with state-of-the-art performance.

Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potentialfor posting "deceptive opinion spam" -- fictitious reviews that have beendeliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. But while thispractice has received considerable public attention and concern, relativelylittle is known about the actual prevalence, or rate, of deception in onlinereview communities, and less still about the factors that influence it. We propose a generative model of deception which, in conjunction with adeception classifier, we use to explore the prevalence of deception in sixpopular online review communities: Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline,TripAdvisor, and Yelp. We additionally propose a theoretical model of onlinereviews based on economic signaling theory, in which consumer reviews diminishthe inherent information asymmetry between consumers and producers, by actingas a signal to a product's true, unknown quality. We find that deceptiveopinion spam is a growing problem overall, but with different growth ratesacross communities. These rates, we argue, are driven by the differentsignaling costs associated with deception for each review community, e.g.,posting requirements. When measures are taken to increase signaling cost, e.g.,filtering reviews written by first-time reviewers, deception prevalence iseffectively reduced.

It is widely believed that thel1- norm sparsity constraint on coding coefficients plays a key role in thesuccess of SRC, while its use of all training samples to collaborativelyrepresent the query sample is rather ignored. In this paper we discuss how SRCworks, and show that the collaborative representation mechanism used in SRC ismuch more crucial to its success of face classification. The SRC is a specialcase of collaborative representation based classification (CRC), which hasvarious instantiations by applying different norms to the coding residual andcoding coefficient. More specifically, the l1 or l2 norm characterization ofcoding residual is related to the robustness of CRC to outlier facial pixels,while the l1 or l2 norm characterization of coding coefficient is related tothe degree of discrimination of facial features. Extensive experiments wereconducted to verify the face recognition accuracy and efficiency of CRC withdifferent instantiations.

Hard-thresholding methods such as $l_0$ regularization aretheoretically ideal but computationally infeasible. In this paper, we propose anew approach, called the LAGS, short for "least absulute gradient selector", tothis challenging yet interesting problem by mimicking the discrete selectionprocess of $l_0$ regularization. To estimate $\beta$ under the influence ofnoise, we consider, nevertheless, the following convex program [\hat{\beta} =\textrm{arg min}\frac{1}{n}\X^{T}(y - X\beta)\_1 + \lambda_n\sum_{i =1}^pw_i(y;X;n)\beta_i] $\lambda_n > 0$ controls the sparsity and $w_i > 0$ dependent on $y, X$ and$n$ is the weights on different $\beta_i$; $n$ is the sample size.Surprisingly, we shall show in the paper, both geometrically and analytically,that LAGS enjoys two attractive properties: (1) LAGS demonstrates discreteselection behavior and hard thresholding property as $l_0$ regularization bystrategically chosen $w_i$, we call this property "pseudo-hard thresholding";(2) Asymptotically, LAGS is consistent and capable of discovering the truemodel; nonasymptotically, LAGS is capable of identifying the sparsity in themodel and the prediction error of the coefficients is bounded at the noiselevel up to a logarithmic factor---$\log p$, where $p$ is the number ofpredictors. Computationally, LAGS can be solved efficiently by convex program routinesfor its convexity or by simplex algorithm after recasting it into a linearprogram. The numeric simulation shows that LAGS is superior compared tosoft-thresholding methods in terms of mean squared error and parsimony of themodel.

In many applications data are often partially corruptedwith large additive noise. When the positions of noise are known, some existingvariants of NMF can be applied by treating these corrupted entries as missingvalues. However, the positions are often unknown in many real worldapplications, which prevents the usage of traditional NMF or other existingvariants of NMF. This paper proposes a Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(RobustNMF) algorithm that explicitly models the partial corruption as largeadditive noise without requiring the information of positions of noise. Inpractice, large additive noise can be used to model outliers. In particular,the proposed method jointly approximates the clean data matrix with the productof two nonnegative matrices and estimates the positions and values ofoutliers/noise. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm with a solidtheoretical justification has been proposed to learn the desired matrixfactorization. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposedalgorithm.

While common link analysis models are limited to single-typelink prediction, we attempt here to capture the correlations among differentrelation types and reveal the impact of various relation types on performancequality. For that, we define the overall relations between object pairs as a\textit{link pattern} which consists in interaction pattern and connectionstructure in the network, and then use tensor formalization to jointly modeland predict the link patterns, which we refer to as \textit{Link PatternPrediction} (LPP) problem. To address the issue, we propose a ProbabilisticLatent Tensor Factorization (PLTF) model by introducing another latent factorfor multiple relation types and furnish the Hierarchical Bayesian treatment ofthe proposed probabilistic model to avoid overfitting for solving the LPPproblem. To learn the proposed model we develop an efficient Markov Chain MonteCarlo sampling method. Extensive experiments are conducted on several realworld datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over several existingstate-of-the-art methods.

Previous studies either consider latent featurebased models but disregarding local structure in the network, or focusexclusively on capturing local structure of objects based on latent blockmodelswithout coupling with latent characteristics of objects. To combine thebenefits of the previous work, we propose a novel model that can simultaneouslyincorporate the effect of latent features and covariates if any, as well as theeffect of latent structure that may exist in the data. To achieve this, wemodel the relation graph as a function of both latent feature factors andlatent cluster memberships of objects to collectively discover globallypredictive intrinsic properties of objects and capture latent block structurein the network to improve prediction performance. We also develop anoptimization transfer algorithm based on the generalized EM-style strategy tolearn the latent factors. We prove the efficacy of our proposed model throughthe link prediction task and cluster analysis task, and extensive experimentson the synthetic data and several real world datasets suggest that our proposedLFBM model outperforms the other state of the art approaches in the evaluatedtasks.

The term "representative" isin itself challenging to define, and various tasks require differentgranularities of concepts. In this paper, we aim to model concepts that aresparse over the vocabulary, and that flexibly adapt their content based onother relevant semantic information such as textual structure or associatedimage features. We explore a Bayesian nonparametric model based on nested betaprocesses that allows for inferring an unknown number of strictly sparseconcepts. The resulting model provides an inherently different representationof concepts than a standard LDA (or HDP) based topic model, and allows fordirect incorporation of semantic features.

In this paper, we introduce a completely new way to obtainingmore well-posed NMF problems whose solutions are sparser. Our technique isbased on the preprocessing of the nonnegative input data matrix, and relies onthe theory of M-matrices and the geometric interpretation of NMF. This approachprovably leads to optimal and sparse solutions under the separabilityassumption of Donoho and Stodden (NIPS, 2003), and, for rank-three matrices,makes the number of exact factorizations finite. We illustrate theeffectiveness of our technique on several image datasets.
arxiv-600-140 | Coherence Functions with Applications in Large-Margin Classification Methods | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.2049v1.pdf | author:Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan category:stat.ML published:2012-04-10 summary:Support vector machines (SVMs) naturally embody sparseness due to their useof hinge loss functions. However, SVMs can not directly estimate conditionalclass probabilities. In this paper we propose and study a family of coherencefunctions, which are convex and differentiable, as surrogates of the hingefunction. The coherence function is derived by using the maximum-entropyprinciple and is characterized by a temperature parameter. It bridges the hingefunction and the logit function in logistic regression. The limit of thecoherence function at zero temperature corresponds to the hinge function, andthe limit of the minimizer of its expected error is the minimizer of theexpected error of the hinge loss. We refer to the use of the coherence functionin large-margin classification as C-learning, and we present efficientcoordinate descent algorithms for the training of regularized ${\calC}$-learning models.

A lot ofresearch work has been done in this field but there is a need to categorize acollection of text documents into mutually exclusive categories by extractingthe concepts or features using supervised learning paradigm and differentclassification algorithms. In this paper, a new Fuzzy Similarity Based ConceptMining Model (FSCMM) is proposed to classify a set of text documents into pre -defined Category Groups (CG) by providing them training and preparing on thesentence, document and integrated corpora levels along with feature reduction,ambiguity removal on each level to achieve high system performance. FuzzyFeature Category Similarity Analyzer (FFCSA) is used to analyze each extractedfeature of Integrated Corpora Feature Vector (ICFV) with the correspondingcategories or classes. This model uses Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC)to classify correctly the training data patterns into two groups; i. e., + 1and - 1, thereby producing accurate and correct results. The proposed modelworks efficiently and effectively with great performance and high - accuracyresults.
arxiv-600-142 | Co-clustering for directed graphs: the Stochastic co-Blockmodel and spectral algorithm Di-Sim | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.2296v2.pdf | author:Karl Rohe, Tai Qin, Bin Yu category:stat.ML math.ST stat.TH published:2012-04-10 summary:Directed graphs have asymmetric connections, yet the current graph clusteringmethodologies cannot identify the potentially global structure of theseasymmetries. We give a spectral algorithm called di-sim that builds on a dualmeasure of similarity that correspond to how a node (i) sends and (ii) receivesedges. Using di-sim, we analyze the global asymmetries in the networks of Enronemails, political blogs, and the c elegans neural connectome. In each example,a small subset of nodes have persistent asymmetries; these nodes send edgeswith one cluster, but receive edges with another cluster. Previous approacheswould have assigned these asymmetric nodes to only one cluster, failing toidentify their sending/receiving asymmetries. Regularization and "projection"are two steps of di-sim that are essential for spectral clustering algorithmsto work in practice. The theoretical results show that these steps make thealgorithm weakly consistent under the degree corrected Stochasticco-Blockmodel, a model that generalizes the Stochastic Blockmodel to allow forboth (i) degree heterogeneity and (ii) the global asymmetries that we intend todetect. The theoretical results make no assumptions on the smallest degreenodes. Instead, the theorem requires that the average degree grows sufficientlyfast and that the weak consistency only applies to the subset of the nodes withsufficiently large leverage scores. The results results also apply to bipartitegraphs.

arxiv-600-145 | Asymptotic Accuracy of Distribution-Based Estimation for Latent Variables | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.2069v4.pdf | author:Keisuke Yamazaki category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2012-04-10 summary:Hierarchical statistical models are widely employed in information scienceand data engineering. The models consist of two types of variables: observablevariables that represent the given data and latent variables for theunobservable labels. An asymptotic analysis of the models plays an importantrole in evaluating the learning process; the result of the analysis is appliednot only to theoretical but also to practical situations, such as optimal modelselection and active learning. There are many studies of generalization errors,which measure the prediction accuracy of the observable variables. However, theaccuracy of estimating the latent variables has not yet been elucidated. For aquantitative evaluation of this, the present paper formulatesdistribution-based functions for the errors in the estimation of the latentvariables. The asymptotic behavior is analyzed for both the maximum likelihoodand the Bayes methods.

Lobo, Ali Mollahosseini, Hamid Reza Shahbazkia category:cs.NE published:2012-04-10 summary:This paper describes the application of a real coded genetic algorithm (GA)to align two or more 2-D images by means of image registration. The proposedsearch strategy is a transformation parameters-based approach involving theaffine transform. The real coded GA uses Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX), aparent-centric recombination operator that has shown to deliver a goodperformance in many optimization problems in the continuous domain. Inaddition, we propose a new technique for matching points between a warped andstatic images by using a randomized ordering when visiting the points duringthe matching procedure. This new technique makes the evaluation of theobjective function somewhat noisy, but GAs and other population-based searchalgorithms have been shown to cope well with noisy fitness evaluations. Theresults obtained are competitive to those obtained by state-of-the-artclassical methods in image registration, confirming the usefulness of theproposed noisy objective function and the suitability of SBX as a recombinationoperator for this type of problem.

The watershed transform associates to atopographic surface a partition into catchment basins, defined as attractionzones of a drop of water falling on the relief and following a line of steepestdescent. Unfortunately, catchment basins may overlap and do not form apartition. Moreover, current watershed algorithms, being shortsighted, do notcorrectly estimate the steepness of the downwards trajectories and overestimatethe overlapping zones of catchment basins. An arbitrary division of these zonesbetween adjacent catchment basin results in a poor localization of thecontours. We propose an algorithm without myopia, which considers the totallength of a trajectory for estimating its steepness. We first considertopographic surfaces defined on node weighted graphs. The graphs are pruned inorder to eliminate all downwards trajectories which are not the steepest. Aniterative algorithm with simple neighborhood operations performs the pruningand constructs the catchment basins. The algorithm is then adapted to gray toneimages. The graph structure itself is encoded as an image thanks to the fixedneighborhood structure of grids. A pair of adaptative erosions and dilationsprune the graph and extend the catchment basins. As a result one obtains aprecise detection of the catchment basins and a graph of the steepesttrajectories. A last iterative algorithm allows to follow selected downwardstrajectories in order to detect particular structures such as rivers or thalweglines of the topographic surface.

The implementation of electronic tollcollection allows vehicles to travel at low or full speed during the tollpayment, which help to avoid the traffic delay at toll road. One of the majorcomponents of an electronic toll collection is the automatic vehicle detectionand classification (AVDC) system which is important to classify the vehicle sothat the toll is charged according to the vehicle classes. Vision-based vehicleclassification system is one type of vehicle classification system which adoptcamera as the input sensing device for the system. This type of system hasadvantage over the rest for it is cost efficient as low cost camera is used.The implementation of vision-based vehicle classification system requires lowerinitial investment cost and very suitable for the toll collection trendmigration in Malaysia from single ETC system to full-scale multi-lane free flow(MLFF).

In this project, aunique way to image description as matching medium is proposed. Thisdistinctiveness of method is analogous to the human DNA concept which is highlyunique.

arxiv-600-151 | Learning Topic Models - Going beyond SVD | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1956v2.pdf | author:Sanjeev Arora, Rong Ge, Ankur Moitra category:cs.LG cs.DS cs.IR published:2012-04-09 summary:Topic Modeling is an approach used for automatic comprehension andclassification of data in a variety of settings, and perhaps the canonicalapplication is in uncovering thematic structure in a corpus of documents. Anumber of foundational works both in machine learning and in theory havesuggested a probabilistic model for documents, whereby documents arise as aconvex combination of (i.e. distribution on) a small number of topic vectors,each topic vector being a distribution on words (i.e. a vector ofword-frequencies). Similar models have since been used in a variety ofapplication areas; the Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA model of Blei et al.is especially popular. Theoretical studies of topic modeling focus on learning the model'sparameters assuming the data is actually generated from it. Existing approachesfor the most part rely on Singular Value Decomposition(SVD), and consequentlyhave one of two limitations: these works need to either assume that eachdocument contains only one topic, or else can only recover the span of thetopic vectors instead of the topic vectors themselves. This paper formally justifies Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(NMF) as a maintool in this context, which is an analog of SVD where all vectors arenonnegative. Using this tool we give the first polynomial-time algorithm forlearning topic models without the above two limitations. The algorithm uses afairly mild assumption about the underlying topic matrix called separability,which is usually found to hold in real-life data. A compelling feature of ouralgorithm is that it generalizes to models that incorporate topic-topiccorrelations, such as the Correlated Topic Model and the Pachinko AllocationModel. We hope that this paper will motivate further theoretical results that useNMF as a replacement for SVD - just as NMF has come to replace SVD in manyapplications.

Motivated by theimportance of power-law distributions in statistical modeling, in this paper,we propose the notion of power-law kernels to investigate power-laws inlearning problem. We propose two power-law kernels by generalizing Gaussian andLaplacian kernels. This generalization is based on distributions, arising outof maximization of a generalized information measure known as nonextensiveentropy that is very well studied in statistical mechanics. We prove that theproposed kernels are positive definite, and provide some insights regarding thecorresponding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We also study practicalsignificance of both kernels in classification and regression, and present somesimulation results.

Jennings category:cs.AI cs.LG published:2012-04-09 summary:In budget-limited multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems, the learner's actionsare costly and constrained by a fixed budget. Consequently, an optimalexploitation policy may not be to pull the optimal arm repeatedly, as is thecase in other variants of MAB, but rather to pull the sequence of differentarms that maximises the agent's total reward within the budget. This differencefrom existing MABs means that new approaches to maximising the total reward arerequired. Given this, we develop two pulling policies, namely: (i) KUBE; and(ii) fractional KUBE. Whereas the former provides better performance up to 40%in our experimental settings, the latter is computationally less expensive. Wealso prove logarithmic upper bounds for the regret of both policies, and showthat these bounds are asymptotically optimal (i.e. they only differ from thebest possible regret by a constant factor).

Existing literature focuses on linear models orgeneralized linear models with Lipschitz loss functions, where the empiricalrisk functions are the summations of independent and identically distributed(iid) losses. The summands in the negative log partial likelihood function forcensored survival data, however, are neither iid nor Lipschitz. We firstapproximate the negative log partial likelihood function by a sum of iidnon-Lipschitz terms, then derive the non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for thelasso penalized Cox regression using pointwise arguments to tackle thedifficulty caused by the lack of iid and Lipschitz property.

Coleman category:cs.IT cs.AI math.IT stat.ML published:2012-04-09 summary:We propose a graphical model for representing networks of stochasticprocesses, the minimal generative model graph. It is based on reducedfactorizations of the joint distribution over time. We show that underappropriate conditions, it is unique and consistent with another type ofgraphical model, the directed information graph, which is based on ageneralization of Granger causality. We demonstrate how directed informationquantifies Granger causality in a particular sequential prediction setting. Wealso develop efficient methods to estimate the topological structure from datathat obviate estimating the joint statistics. One algorithm assumesupper-bounds on the degrees and uses the minimal dimension statisticsnecessary. In the event that the upper-bounds are not valid, the resultinggraph is nonetheless an optimal approximation. Another algorithm usesnear-minimal dimension statistics when no bounds are known but the distributionsatisfies a certain criterion. Analogous to how structure learning algorithmsfor undirected graphical models use mutual information estimates, thesealgorithms use directed information estimates. We characterize thesample-complexity of two plug-in directed information estimators and obtainconfidence intervals. For the setting when point estimates are unreliable, wepropose an algorithm that uses confidence intervals to identify the bestapproximation that is robust to estimation error. Lastly, we demonstrate theeffectiveness of the proposed algorithms through analysis of both syntheticdata and real data from the Twitter network. In the latter case, we identifywhich news sources influence users in the network by merely analyzing tweettimes.

Theclassical model of STDP which considers the timing between pairs ofpre-synaptic and post-synaptic spikes (p-STDP) is incapable of reproducingsynaptic weight changes similar to those seen in biological experiments whichinvestigate the effect of either higher order spike trains (e.g. triplet andquadruplet of spikes), or, simultaneous effect of the rate and timing of spikepairs on synaptic plasticity. In this paper, we firstly investigate synapticweight changes using a p-STDP circuit and show how it fails to reproduce thementioned complex biological experiments. We then present a new STDP VLSIcircuit which acts based on the timing among triplets of spikes (t-STDP) thatis able to reproduce all the mentioned experimental results. We believe thatour new STDP VLSI circuit improves upon previous circuits, whose learningcapacity exceeds current designs due to its capability of mimicking theoutcomes of biological experiments more closely; thus plays a significant rolein future VLSI implementation of neuromorphic systems.

Vimala category:cs.CV published:2012-04-08 summary:In this paper, we have proposed an extended version of Absolute Moment BlockTruncation Coding (AMBTC) to compress images. Generally the elements of abitplane used in the variants of Block Truncation Coding (BTC) are of size 1bit. But it has been extended to two bits in the proposed method. Number ofstatistical moments preserved to reconstruct the compressed has also beenraised from 2 to 4. Hence, the quality of the reconstructed images has beenimproved significantly from 33.62 to 38.12 with the increase in bpp by 1. Theincreased bpp (3) is further reduced to 1.75in multiple levels: in one level,by dropping 4 elements of the bitplane in such a away that the pixel values ofthe dropped elements can easily be interpolated with out much of loss in thequality, in level two, eight elements are dropped and reconstructed later andin level three, the size of the statistical moments is reduced. The experimentswere carried over standard images of varying intensities. In all the cases, theproposed method outperforms the existing AMBTC technique in terms of both PSNRand bpp.

A related task is choosing samplesfor estimating integrals using Bayesian quadrature. We show that the criterionminimised when selecting samples in kernel herding is equivalent to theposterior variance in Bayesian quadrature. We then show that sequentialBayesian quadrature can be viewed as a weighted version of kernel herding whichachieves performance superior to any other weighted herding method. Wedemonstrate empirically a rate of convergence faster than O(1/N). Our resultsalso imply an upper bound on the empirical error of the Bayesian quadratureestimate.

An EM algorithm is developed to estimate parameters of the Gaussianmixtures. The finite mixture is a flexible and powerful probabilistic modelingtool. It can be used to provide a model-based clustering in the field ofpattern recognition. However, the application of finite mixtures to imagesegmentation presents some difficulties; especially it's sensible to noise. Inthis paper we propose a variant of this method which aims to resolve thisproblem. Our approach proceeds by the characterization of pixels by twofeatures: the first one describes the intrinsic properties of the pixel and thesecond characterizes the neighborhood of pixel. Then the classification is madeon the base on adaptive distance which privileges the one or the other featuresaccording to the spatial position of the pixel in the image. The obtainedresults have shown a significant improvement of our approach compared to thestandard version of EM algorithm.

A machine learning paradigm popular within Cognitive Network relatedtopics (e.g., Spectrum Sensing and Allocation). We focus on the case where therewards are exponentially distributed, which is common when dealing withRayleigh fading channels. This strategy, named Multiplicative Upper ConfidenceBound (MUCB), associates a utility index to every available arm, and thenselects the arm with the highest index. For every arm, the associated index isequal to the product of a multiplicative factor by the sample mean of therewards collected by this arm. We show that the MUCB policy has a lowcomplexity and is order optimal.

In order to validate the feasibilityand effectively, we compare the results of GFAN to FAN and to the othersclassifiers (NB, GTAN, TAN). The results demonstrate FAN outperforms than GFAN,NB, GTAN and TAN in the overall classification accuracy.

These methods invoke some assumptions that link themarginal distribution $P_X$ of X to the regression function f(x). For example,it is common to assume that f is very smooth over high density regions of$P_X$. Many of the methods are ad-hoc and have been shown to work in specificexamples but are lacking a theoretical foundation. We provide a minimaxframework for analyzing semisupervised methods. In particular, we study methodsbased on metrics that are sensitive to the distribution $P_X$. Our modelincludes a parameter $\alpha$ that controls the strength of the semisupervisedassumption. We then use the data to adapt to $\alpha$.

Jordan category:math.ST cs.LG stat.ML stat.TH published:2012-04-07 summary:We consider the predictive problem of supervised ranking, where the task isto rank sets of candidate items returned in response to queries. Although thereexist statistical procedures that come with guarantees of consistency in thissetting, these procedures require that individuals provide a complete rankingof all items, which is rarely feasible in practice. Instead, individualsroutinely provide partial preference information, such as pairwise comparisonsof items, and more practical approaches to ranking have aimed at modeling thispartial preference data directly. As we show, however, such an approach raisesserious theoretical challenges. Indeed, we demonstrate that many commonly usedsurrogate losses for pairwise comparison data do not yield consistency;surprisingly, we show inconsistency even in low-noise settings. With thesenegative results as motivation, we present a new approach to supervised rankingbased on aggregation of partial preferences, and we develop $U$-statistic-basedempirical risk minimization procedures. We present an asymptotic analysis ofthese new procedures, showing that they yield consistency results that parallelthose available for classification. We complement our theoretical results withan experiment studying the new procedures in a large-scale web-ranking task.

Several mixed-normbased sparse models have received substantial attention, and for some casesefficient algorithms are also available. Surprisingly, several constrainedsparse models seem to be lacking scalable algorithms. We address thisdeficiency by presenting batch and online (stochastic-gradient) optimizationmethods, both of which rely on efficient projections onto mixed-norm balls. Weillustrate our methods by applying them to the multitask lasso. We conclude bymentioning some open problems.

D. Rezaee category:cs.DS cs.LG published:2012-04-06 summary:The rough-set theory proposed by Pawlak, has been widely used in dealing withdata classification problems. The original rough-set model is, however, quitesensitive to noisy data. Tzung thus proposed deals with the problem ofproducing a set of fuzzy certain and fuzzy possible rules from quantitativedata with a predefined tolerance degree of uncertainty and misclassification.This model allowed, which combines the variable precision rough-set model andthe fuzzy set theory, is thus proposed to solve this problem. This paper thusdeals with the problem of producing a set of fuzzy certain and fuzzy possiblerules from incomplete quantitative data with a predefined tolerance degree ofuncertainty and misclassification. A new method, incomplete quantitative datafor rough-set model and the fuzzy set theory, is thus proposed to solve thisproblem. It first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set oflinguistic terms using membership functions and then finding incompletequantitative data with lower and the fuzzy upper approximations. It secondcalculates the fuzzy {\beta}-lower and the fuzzy {\beta}-upper approximations.The certain and possible rules are then generated based on these fuzzyapproximations. These rules can then be used to classify unknown objects.

Fontanari category:q-bio.NC cs.LG published:2012-04-06 summary:An explanation for the acquisition of word-object mappings is the associativelearning in a cross-situational scenario. Here we present analytical results ofthe performance of a simple associative learning algorithm for acquiring aone-to-one mapping between $N$ objects and $N$ words based solely on theco-occurrence between objects and words. In particular, a learning trial in ourlearning scenario consists of the presentation of $C + 1 < N$ objects togetherwith a target word, which refers to one of the objects in the context. We findthat the learning times are distributed exponentially and the learning ratesare given by $\ln{[\frac{N(N-1)}{C + (N-1)^{2}}]}$ in the case the $N$ targetwords are sampled randomly and by $\frac{1}{N} \ln [\frac{N-1}{C}] $ in thecase they follow a deterministic presentation sequence. This learningperformance is much superior to those exhibited by humans and more realisticlearning algorithms in cross-situational experiments. We show that introductionof discrimination limitations using Weber's law and forgetting reduce theperformance of the associative algorithm to the human level.

So Intrusion Detection Systems havebecome a needful component in terms of computer and network security. There arevarious approaches being utilized in intrusion detections, but unfortunatelyany of the systems so far is not completely flawless. So, the quest ofbetterment continues. In this progression, here we present an IntrusionDetection System (IDS), by applying genetic algorithm (GA) to efficientlydetect various types of network intrusions. Parameters and evolution processesfor GA are discussed in details and implemented. This approach uses evolutiontheory to information evolution in order to filter the traffic data and thusreduce the complexity. To implement and measure the performance of our systemwe used the KDD99 benchmark dataset and obtained reasonable detection rate.

State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on theexplicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case ifscalability should be maintained. There are few if any implicit feedbackbenchmark datasets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicitbenchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedbackrecommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS apply a fast, ALS-based tensorfactorization learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zeroelements in the tensor. The method also allows us to incorporate diversecontext information into the model while maintaining its computationalefficiency. In particular, we present two such context-aware implementationvariants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables todistinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the userhistory as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usagepattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apartproduct types or categories that are typically purchased repetitively(collectibles, grocery goods) or once (household appliances). Experimentsperformed on three implicit datasets (two proprietary ones and an implicitvariant of the Netflix dataset) show that by integrating context-awareinformation with our factorization framework into the state-of-the-art implicitrecommender algorithm the recommendation quality improves significantly.

The upper bounds are universal, and thelower bounds hold for the rich family of sub-Gaussian distributions withindependent features. We conclude that this new quantity tightly characterizesthe true sample complexity of large-margin classification. To prove the lowerbound, we develop several new tools of independent interest. These include newconnections between shattering and hardness of learning, new properties ofshattering with linear classifiers, and a new lower bound on the smallesteigenvalue of a random Gram matrix generated by sub-Gaussian variables. Ourresults can be used to quantitatively compare large margin learning to otherlearning rules, and to improve the effectiveness of methods that use samplecomplexity bounds, such as active learning.

Giannakis category:stat.ML math.OC published:2012-04-04 summary:Deregulation of energy markets, penetration of renewables, advanced meteringcapabilities, and the urge for situational awareness, all call for system-widepower system state estimation (PSSE). Implementing a centralized estimatorthough is practically infeasible due to the complexity scale of aninterconnection, the communication bottleneck in real-time monitoring, regionaldisclosure policies, and reliability issues. In this context, distributed PSSEmethods are treated here under a unified and systematic framework. A novelalgorithm is developed based on the alternating direction method ofmultipliers. It leverages existing PSSE solvers, respects privacy policies,exhibits low communication load, and its convergence to the centralizedestimates is guaranteed even in the absence of local observability. Beyond theconventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework accommodatesa robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links to the compressivesampling advances, the latter jointly estimates the state and identifiescorrupted measurements. The novel algorithms are numerically evaluated usingthe IEEE 14-, 118-bus, and a 4,200-bus benchmarks. Simulations demonstrate thatthe attainable accuracy can be reached within a few inter-area exchanges, whilelargest residual tests are outperformed.

Our approach hinges on the observation that much of the existinglinear theory may be readily extended to nonlinear systems - with a reasonableexpectation of success - once the nonlinear system has been mapped into a highor infinite dimensional feature space. In particular, we develop computable,non-parametric estimators approximating controllability and observabilityenergy functions for nonlinear systems, and study the ellipsoids they induce.In all cases the relevant quantities are estimated from simulated or observeddata. It is then shown that the controllability energy estimator provides a keymeans for approximating the invariant measure of an ergodic, stochasticallyforced nonlinear system.

Hero III, Shuheng Zhou category:stat.ME stat.ML published:2012-04-03 summary:This paper studies iteration convergence of Kronecker graphical lasso(KGLasso) algorithms for estimating the covariance of an i.i.d. Gaussian randomsample under a sparse Kronecker-product covariance model and MSE convergencerates. The KGlasso model, originally called the transposable regularizedcovariance model by Allen ["Transposable regularized covariance models with anapplication to missing data imputation," Ann. Appl. Statist., vol. 4, no. 2,pp. 764-790, 2010], implements a pair of $\ell_1$ penalties on each Kroneckerfactor to enforce sparsity in the covariance estimator. The KGlasso algorithmgeneralizes Glasso, introduced by Yuan and Lin ["Model selection and estimationin the Gaussian graphical model," Biometrika, vol. 94, pp. 19-35, 2007] andBanerjee ["Model selection through sparse maximum likelihood estimation formultivariate Gaussian or binary data," J. Mach. Learn. Res., vol. 9, pp.485-516, Mar. 2008], to estimate covariances having Kronecker product form. Italso generalizes the unpenalized ML flip-flop (FF) algorithm of Dutilleul ["TheMLE algorithm for the matrix normal distribution," J. Statist. Comput. Simul.,vol. 64, pp. 105-123, 1999] and Werner ["On estimation of covariance matriceswith Kronecker product structure," IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 56, no. 2,pp. 478-491, Feb. 2008] to estimation of sparse Kronecker factors. We establishthat the KGlasso iterates converge pointwise to a local maximum of thepenalized likelihood function. We derive high dimensional rates of convergenceto the true covariance as both the number of samples and the number ofvariables go to infinity. Our results establish that KGlasso has significantlyfaster asymptotic convergence than Glasso and FF. Simulations are presentedthat validate the results of our analysis.

Yarman Vural category:cs.LG cs.CV published:2012-04-01 summary:In this study, a new Stacked Generalization technique called Fuzzy StackedGeneralization (FSG) is proposed to minimize the difference between N -sampleand large-sample classification error of the Nearest Neighbor classifier. Theproposed FSG employs a new hierarchical distance learning strategy to minimizethe error difference. For this purpose, we first construct an ensemble ofbase-layer fuzzy k- Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers, each of which receivesa different feature set extracted from the same sample set. The fuzzymembership values computed at the decision space of each fuzzy k-NN classifierare concatenated to form the feature vectors of a fusion space. Finally, thefeature vectors are fed to a meta-layer classifier to learn the degree ofaccuracy of the decisions of the base-layer classifiers for meta-layerclassification. Rather than the power of the individual base layer-classifiers,diversity and cooperation of the classifiers become an important issue toimprove the overall performance of the proposed FSG. A weak base-layerclassifier may boost the overall performance more than a strong classifier, ifit is capable of recognizing the samples, which are not recognized by the restof the classifiers, in its own feature space. The experiments explore the typeof the collaboration among the individual classifiers required for an improvedperformance of the suggested architecture. Experiments on multiple featurereal-world datasets show that the proposed FSG performs better than the stateof the art ensemble learning algorithms such as Adaboost, Random Subspace andRotation Forest. On the other hand, compatible performances are observed in theexperiments on single feature multi-attribute datasets.

In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate batchalgorithm, active belief propagation (ABP), for training LDA. Usually batch LDAalgorithms require repeated scanning of the entire corpus and searching thecomplete topic space. To process massive corpora having a large number oftopics, the training iteration of batch LDA algorithms is often inefficient andtime-consuming. To accelerate the training speed, ABP actively scans the subsetof corpus and searches the subset of topic space for topic modeling, thereforesaves enormous training time in each iteration. To ensure accuracy, ABP selectsonly those documents and topics that contribute to the largest residuals withinthe residual belief propagation (RBP) framework. On four real-world corpora,ABP performs around $10$ to $100$ times faster than state-of-the-art batch LDAalgorithms with a comparable topic modeling accuracy.

Algorithms inthis field aim to find the optimizer of the function by asking only a fewfunction evaluations at locations carefully selected based on a posteriormodel. In this paper, we assume the unknown function is Lipschitz continuous.Leveraging the Lipschitz property, we propose an algorithm with a distinctexploration phase followed by an exploitation phase. The exploration phase aimsto select samples that shrink the search space as much as possible. Theexploitation phase then focuses on the reduced search space and selects samplesclosest to the optimizer. Considering the Expected Improvement (EI) as abaseline, we empirically show that the proposed algorithm significantlyoutperforms EI.

The problems encountered in engineering and socialsciences are commonly characterized by over-abundance of explanatory variables,non-linearities and unknown interdependencies between the regressors. An addeddifficulty is that the analysts may have little or no prior knowledge on therelative importance of the variables. To provide a robust method for modelselection, this paper introduces the Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm forVariable Selection (MOGA-VS) that provides the user with an optimal set ofregression models for a given data-set. The algorithm considers the regressionproblem as a two objective task, and explores the Pareto-optimal (best subset)models by preferring those models over the other which have less number ofregression coefficients and better goodness of fit. The model exploration canbe performed based on in-sample or generalization error minimization. The modelselection is proposed to be performed in two steps. First, we generate thefrontier of Pareto-optimal regression models by eliminating the dominatedmodels without any user intervention. Second, a decision making process isexecuted which allows the user to choose the most preferred model usingvisualizations and simple metrics. The method has been evaluated on a recentlypublished real dataset on Communities and Crime within United States.

In theory, the study can help understanding theability of evolutionary algorithms. In practice, the study may provide aguideline to the design of benchmarks. The aim of this paper is to answer thefollowing research questions: Given a fitness function class, which functionsare the easiest with respect to an evolutionary algorithm? Which are thehardest? How are these functions constructed? The paper provides theoreticalanswers to these questions. The easiest and hardest fitness functions areconstructed for an elitist (1+1) evolutionary algorithm to maximise a class offitness functions with the same optima. It is demonstrated that the unimodalfunctions are the easiest and deceptive functions are the hardest in terms ofthe time-fitness landscape. The paper also reveals that the easiest fitnessfunction to one algorithm may become the hardest to another algorithm, and viceversa.

We consider whether,and how, the way in which the information is phrased --- the choice of wordsand sentence structure --- can affect this process. To this end, we develop ananalysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated withmemorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speakerand the setting of the quotes. We find that there are significant differencesbetween memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions, evenafter controlling for situational and contextual factors. One is lexicaldistinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices,but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns.Another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make themeasy to apply in new contexts --- that is, more portable. We also show how theconcept of "memorable language" can be extended across domains.
arxiv-600-198 | Greedy Sparsity-Constrained Optimization | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5483v3.pdf | author:Sohail Bahmani, Bhiksha Raj, Petros Boufounos category:stat.ML math.NA math.OC stat.CO 62FXX, 65KXX published:2012-03-25 summary:Sparsity-constrained optimization has wide applicability in machine learning,statistics, and signal processing problems such as feature selection andcompressive Sensing. A vast body of work has studied the sparsity-constrainedoptimization from theoretical, algorithmic, and application aspects in thecontext of sparse estimation in linear models where the fidelity of theestimate is measured by the squared error. In contrast, relatively less efforthas been made in the study of sparsity-constrained optimization in cases wherenonlinear models are involved or the cost function is not quadratic. In thispaper we propose a greedy algorithm, Gradient Support Pursuit (GraSP), toapproximate sparse minima of cost functions of arbitrary form. Should a costfunction have a Stable Restricted Hessian (SRH) or a Stable RestrictedLinearization (SRL), both of which are introduced in this paper, our algorithmis guaranteed to produce a sparse vector within a bounded distance from thetrue sparse optimum. Our approach generalizes known results for quadratic costfunctions that arise in sparse linear regression and Compressive Sensing. Wealso evaluate the performance of GraSP through numerical simulations onsynthetic data, where the algorithm is employed for sparse logistic regressionwith and without $\ell_2$-regularization.

Hauschild, Pier Luca Lanzi category:cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG published:2012-03-24 summary:An automated technique has recently been proposed to transfer learning in thehierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) based on distance-basedstatistics. The technique enables practitioners to improve hBOA efficiency bycollecting statistics from probabilistic models obtained in previous hBOA runsand using the obtained statistics to bias future hBOA runs on similar problems.The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) test the technique on severalclasses of NP-complete problems, including MAXSAT, spin glasses and minimumvertex cover; (2) demonstrate that the technique is effective even whenprevious runs were done on problems of different size; (3) provide empiricalevidence that combining transfer learning with other efficiency enhancementtechniques can often yield nearly multiplicative speedups.
arxiv-600-200 | Acceleration of the shiftable O(1) algorithm for bilateral filtering and non-local means | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5128v2.pdf | author:Kunal N. Chaudhury category:cs.CV cs.DC published:2012-03-22 summary:A direct implementation of the bilateral filter [1] requires O(\sigma_s^2)operations per pixel, where \sigma_s is the (effective) width of the spatialkernel. A fast implementation of the bilateral filter was recently proposed in[2] that required O(1) operations per pixel with respect to \sigma_s. This wasdone by using trigonometric functions for the range kernel of the bilateralfilter, and by exploiting their so-called shiftability property. In particular,a fast implementation of the Gaussian bilateral filter was realized byapproximating the Gaussian range kernel using raised cosines. Later, it wasdemonstrated in [3] that this idea could be extended to a larger class offilters, including the popular non-local means filter [4]. As already observedin [2], a flip side of this approach was that the run time depended on thewidth \sigma_r of the range kernel. For an image with (local) intensityvariations in the range [0,T], the run time scaled as O(T^2/\sigma^2_r) with\sigma_r. This made it difficult to implement narrow range kernels,particularly for images with large dynamic range. We discuss this problem inthis note, and propose some simple steps to accelerate the implementation ingeneral, and for small \sigma_r in particular. [1] C. Tomasi and R.

This link enables us toinvoke convergence results from convex optimization and to consider fasteralternatives for the task of approximating integrals in a reproducing kernelHilbert space. We study the behavior of the different variants throughnumerical simulations. The experiments indicate that while we can improve overherding on the task of approximating integrals, the original herding algorithmtends to approach more often the maximum entropy distribution, shedding morelight on the learning bias behind herding.

A crucial point in the model building process is theselection of adjusted parameters including a regularization parameter and atuning parameter in bridge regression models. The choice of the adjustedparameters can be viewed as a model selection and evaluation problem. Wepropose a model selection criterion for evaluating bridge regression models interms of Bayesian approach. This selection criterion enables us to select theadjusted parameters objectively. We investigate the effectiveness of ourproposed modeling strategy through some numerical examples.

We characterize conditions for tractable graph estimation anddevelop efficient methods with provable guarantees. We consider models wherethe underlying Markov graph is locally tree-like, and the model is in theregime of correlation decay. For the special case of the Ising model, thenumber of samples $n$ required for structural consistency of our method scalesas $n=\Omega(\theta_{\min}^{-\delta\eta(\eta+1)-2}\log p)$, where p is thenumber of variables, $\theta_{\min}$ is the minimum edge potential, $\delta$ isthe depth (i.e., distance from a hidden node to the nearest observed nodes),and $\eta$ is a parameter which depends on the bounds on node and edgepotentials in the Ising model. Necessary conditions for structural consistencyunder any algorithm are derived and our method nearly matches the lower boundon sample requirements. Further, the proposed method is practical to implementand provides flexibility to control the number of latent variables and thecycle lengths in the output graph.

Turner, Mio Murao category:quant-ph math.ST stat.ML stat.TH published:2012-03-15 summary:We consider 1-qubit mixed quantum state estimation by adaptively updatingmeasurements according to previously obtained outcomes and measurementsettings. Updates are determined by the average-variance-optimality(A-optimality) criterion, known in the classical theory of experimental designand applied here to quantum state estimation. In general, A-optimization is anonlinear minimization problem; however, we find an analytic solution for1-qubit state estimation using projective measurements, reducing computationaleffort. We compare numerically two adaptive and two nonadaptive schemes forfinite data sets and show that the A-optimality criterion gives more preciseestimates than standard quantum tomography.

It is articulated around the following hypotheses: (1)learning in an individual human brain is hampered by the presence of effectivelocal minima; (2) this optimization difficulty is particularly important whenit comes to learning higher-level abstractions, i.e., concepts that cover avast and highly-nonlinear span of sensory configurations; (3) such high-levelabstractions are best represented in brains by the composition of many levelsof representation, i.e., by deep architectures; (4) a human brain can learnsuch high-level abstractions if guided by the signals produced by other humans,which act as hints or indirect supervision for these high-level abstractions;and (5), language and the recombination and optimization of mental conceptsprovide an efficient evolutionary recombination operator, and this gives riseto rapid search in the space of communicable ideas that help humans build upbetter high-level internal representations of their world. These hypotheses puttogether imply that human culture and the evolution of ideas have been crucialto counter an optimization difficulty: this optimization difficulty wouldotherwise make it very difficult for human brains to capture high-levelknowledge of the world. The theory is grounded in experimental observations ofthe difficulties of training deep artificial neural networks. Plausibleconsequences of this theory for the efficiency of cultural evolutions aresketched.

This paper derives a form of thefull Bayes RFS filter and observes that data association is implicitly present,in a data structure similar to MHT. Subsequently, algorithms are obtained byapproximating the distribution of associations. Two algorithms result: onenearly identical to JIPDA, and another related to the MeMBer filter. Bothimprove performance in challenging environments.

More precisely, we consider ageneral regression model with fixed design and measure the distance betweenfunctions by the mean squared error at the design points. While proceduresbased on exponential weights are known to solve the problem of model selectionaggregation in expectation, they are, surprisingly, sub-optimal in deviation.We propose a new formulation called Q-aggregation that addresses thislimitation; namely, its solution leads to sharp oracle inequalities that areoptimal in a minimax sense. Moreover, based on the new formulation, we designgreedy Q-aggregation procedures that produce sparse aggregation modelsachieving the optimal rate. The convergence and performance of these greedyprocedures are illustrated and compared with other standard methods onsimulated examples.

Long category:cs.LG published:2012-03-12 summary:This work explores the effects of relevant and irrelevant boolean variableson the accuracy of classifiers. The analysis uses the assumption that thevariables are conditionally independent given the class, and focuses on anatural family of learning algorithms for such sources when the relevantvariables have a small advantage over random guessing. The main result is thatalgorithms relying predominately on irrelevant variables have errorprobabilities that quickly go to 0 in situations where algorithms that limitthe use of irrelevant variables have errors bounded below by a positiveconstant. We also show that accurate learning is possible even when there areso few examples that one cannot determine with high confidence whether or notany individual variable is relevant.
arxiv-600-209 | Fixed-Rank Representation for Unsupervised Visual Learning | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.2210v2.pdf | author:Risheng Liu, Zhouchen Lin, Fernando De la Torre, Zhixun Su category:cs.CV cs.NA published:2012-03-09 summary:Subspace clustering and feature extraction are two of the most commonly usedunsupervised learning techniques in computer vision and pattern recognition.State-of-the-art techniques for subspace clustering make use of recent advancesin sparsity and rank minimization. However, existing techniques arecomputationally expensive and may result in degenerate solutions that degradeclustering performance in the case of insufficient data sampling. To partiallysolve these problems, and inspired by existing work on matrix factorization,this paper proposes fixed-rank representation (FRR) as a unified framework forunsupervised visual learning. FRR is able to reveal the structure of multiplesubspaces in closed-form when the data is noiseless. Furthermore, we prove thatunder some suitable conditions, even with insufficient observations, FRR canstill reveal the true subspace memberships. To achieve robustness to outliersand noise, a sparse regularizer is introduced into the FRR framework. Beyondsubspace clustering, FRR can be used for unsupervised feature extraction. As anon-trivial byproduct, a fast numerical solver is developed for FRR.Experimental results on both synthetic data and real applications validate ourtheoretical analysis and demonstrate the benefits of FRR for unsupervisedvisual learning.

The importance of tools for natural languageprocessing is materialized by the need to have applications that caneffectively treat the vast mass of information available nowadays on electronicforms. Among these tools, mainly driven by the necessity of a fast writing inalignment to the actual daily life speed, our interest is on the writingauditors. The morphological and syntactic properties of Arabic make it adifficult language to master, and explain the lack in the processing tools forthat language. Among these properties, we can mention: the complex structure ofthe Arabic word, the agglutinative nature, lack of vocalization, thesegmentation of the text, the linguistic richness, etc.

Willsky category:stat.ME stat.AP stat.ML published:2012-03-07 summary:There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden MarkovModel (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitousHidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However,in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable,particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. Wecan extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing uponexplicit-duration semi-Markovianity, which has been developed mainly in theparametric frequentist setting, to allow construction of highly interpretablemodels that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical DirichletProcess Hidden semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms forefficient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide newmethods for sampling inference in the finite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbssampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesianmodels, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesianinference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inferencemethods on both synthetic and real experiments.

This paper addresses the problem of learning a finite linearcombination of infinite-dimensional operator-valued kernels which are suitablefor extending functional data analysis methods to nonlinear contexts. We studythis problem in the case of kernel ridge regression for functional responseswith an lr-norm constraint on the combination coefficients. The resultingoptimization problem is more involved than those of multiple scalar-valuedkernel learning since operator-valued kernels pose more technical andtheoretical issues. We propose a multiple operator-valued kernel learningalgorithm based on solving a system of linear operator equations by using ablock coordinatedescent procedure. We experimentally validate our approach on afunctional regression task in the context of finger movement prediction inbrain-computer interfaces.

GPUs are capable of anorder of magnitude more floating-point operations per second as compared tomodern central processing units (CPUs), and thus provide a great deal ofpromise for computationally intensive statistical applications. Fitting complexstatistical models with a large number of parameters and/or for large datasetsis often very computationally expensive. In this study, we focus on Gaussianprocess (GP) models -- statistical models commonly used for emulating expensivecomputer simulators. We demonstrate that the computational cost of implementingGP models can be significantly reduced by using a CPU+GPU heterogeneouscomputing system over an analogous implementation on a traditional computingsystem with no GPU acceleration. Our small study suggests that GP models arefertile ground for further implementation on CPU+GPU systems.

These models, known as computersimulators, enable experimental study of a virtual representation of thecomplex phenomena. Simulators can be thought of as complex functions that takemany inputs and provide an output. Often these simulators are themselvesexpensive to compute, and may be approximated by "surrogate models" such asstatistical regression models. In this paper we consider a new kind ofsurrogate model, a Bayesian ensemble of trees (Chipman et al. 2010), with thespecific goal of learning enough about the simulator that a particular featureof the simulator can be estimated. We focus on identifying the simulator'sglobal minimum. Utilizing the Bayesian version of the Expected Improvementcriterion (Jones et al. 1998), we show that this ensemble is particularlyeffective when the simulator is ill-behaved, exhibiting nonstationarity orabrupt changes in the response. A number of illustrations of the approach aregiven, including a tidal power application.

Ronda, Antonio Vald√©s, Guillermo Gallego category:cs.CV published:2012-03-05 summary:In 3D reconstruction, the recovery of the calibration parameters of thecameras is paramount since it provides metric information about the observedscene, e.g., measures of angles and ratios of distances. Autocalibrationenables the estimation of the camera parameters without using a calibrationdevice, but by enforcing simple constraints on the camera parameters. In theabsence of information about the internal camera parameters such as the focallength and the principal point, the knowledge of the camera pixel shape isusually the only available constraint. Given a projective reconstruction of arigid scene, we address the problem of the autocalibration of a minimal set ofcameras with known pixel shape and otherwise arbitrarily varying intrinsic andextrinsic parameters. We propose an algorithm that only requires 5 cameras (thetheoretical minimum), thus halving the number of cameras required by previousalgorithms based on the same constraint. To this purpose, we introduce as ourbasic geometric tool the six-line conic variety (SLCV), consisting in the setof planes intersecting six given lines of 3D space in points of a conic. Weshow that the set of solutions of the Euclidean upgrading problem for threecameras with known pixel shape can be parameterized in a computationallyefficient way. This parameterization is then used to solve autocalibration fromfive or more cameras, reducing the three-dimensional search space to atwo-dimensional one. We provide experiments with real images showing the goodperformance of the technique.

The paper applies this frameworkfor data where each task is a phase-shifted periodic time series. Inparticular, we develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric model capturing a mixtureof Gaussian processes where each task is a sum of a group-specific function anda component capturing individual variation, in addition to each task beingphase shifted. We develop an efficient \textsc{em} algorithm to learn theparameters of the model. As a special case we obtain the Gaussian mixture modeland \textsc{em} algorithm for phased-shifted periodic time series. Furthermore,we extend the proposed model by using a Dirichlet Process prior and therebyleading to an infinite mixture model that is capable of doing automatic modelselection. A Variational Bayesian approach is developed for inference in thismodel. Experiments in regression, classification and class discoverydemonstrate the performance of the proposed models using both synthetic dataand real-world time series data from astrophysics. Our methods are particularlyuseful when the time series are sparsely and non-synchronously sampled.

Often, high-dimensional data lie close tolow-dimensional structures corresponding to several classes or categories thedata belongs to. In this paper, we propose and study an algorithm, calledSparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), to cluster data points that lie in a union oflow-dimensional subspaces. The key idea is that, among infinitely many possiblerepresentations of a data point in terms of other points, a sparserepresentation corresponds to selecting a few points from the same subspace.This motivates solving a sparse optimization program whose solution is used ina spectral clustering framework to infer the clustering of data into subspaces.Since solving the sparse optimization program is in general NP-hard, weconsider a convex relaxation and show that, under appropriate conditions on thearrangement of subspaces and the distribution of data, the proposedminimization program succeeds in recovering the desired sparse representations.The proposed algorithm can be solved efficiently and can handle data pointsnear the intersections of subspaces. Another key advantage of the proposedalgorithm with respect to the state of the art is that it can deal with datanuisances, such as noise, sparse outlying entries, and missing entries,directly by incorporating the model of the data into the sparse optimizationprogram. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm throughexperiments on synthetic data as well as the two real-world problems of motionsegmentation and face clustering.

Andrew Bagnell category:cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY stat.ML published:2012-03-05 summary:A fundamental problem in control is to learn a model of a system fromobservations that is useful for controller synthesis. To provide goodperformance guarantees, existing methods must assume that the real system is inthe class of models considered during learning. We present an iterative methodwith strong guarantees even in the agnostic case where the system is not in theclass. In particular, we show that any no-regret online learning algorithm canbe used to obtain a near-optimal policy, provided some model achieves lowtraining error and access to a good exploration distribution. Our approachapplies to both discrete and continuous domains. We demonstrate its efficacyand scalability on a challenging helicopter domain from the literature.

Kakade category:stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG published:2012-03-04 summary:We consider unsupervised estimation of mixtures of discrete graphical models,where the class variable corresponding to the mixture components is hidden andeach mixture component over the observed variables can have a potentiallydifferent Markov graph structure and parameters. We propose a novel approachfor estimating the mixture components, and our output is a tree-mixture modelwhich serves as a good approximation to the underlying graphical model mixture.Our method is efficient when the union graph, which is the union of the Markovgraphs of the mixture components, has sparse vertex separators between any pairof observed variables. This includes tree mixtures and mixtures of boundeddegree graphs. For such models, we prove that our method correctly recovers theunion graph structure and the tree structures corresponding tomaximum-likelihood tree approximations of the mixture components. The sampleand computational complexities of our method scale as $\poly(p, r)$, for an$r$-component mixture of $p$-variate graphical models. We further extend ourresults to the case when the union graph has sparse local separators betweenany pair of observed variables, such as mixtures of locally tree-like graphs,and the mixture components are in the regime of correlation decay.
arxiv-600-221 | Learning DNF Expressions from Fourier Spectrum | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0594v3.pdf | author:Vitaly Feldman category:cs.LG cs.CC cs.DS published:2012-03-03 summary:Since its introduction by Valiant in 1984, PAC learning of DNF expressionsremains one of the central problems in learning theory. We consider thisproblem in the setting where the underlying distribution is uniform, or moregenerally, a product distribution. Kalai, Samorodnitsky and Teng (2009) showedthat in this setting a DNF expression can be efficiently approximated from its"heavy" low-degree Fourier coefficients alone. This is in contrast to previousapproaches where boosting was used and thus Fourier coefficients of the targetfunction modified by various distributions were needed. This property iscrucial for learning of DNF expressions over smoothed product distributions, alearning model introduced by Kalai et al. (2009) and inspired by the seminalsmoothed analysis model of Spielman and Teng (2001). We introduce a new approach to learning (or approximating) a polynomialthreshold functions which is based on creating a function with range [-1,1]that approximately agrees with the unknown function on low-degree Fouriercoefficients. We then describe conditions under which this is sufficient forlearning polynomial threshold functions. Our approach yields a new, simplealgorithm for approximating any polynomial-size DNF expression from its "heavy"low-degree Fourier coefficients alone. Our algorithm greatly simplifies theproof of learnability of DNF expressions over smoothed product distributions.We also describe an application of our algorithm to learning monotone DNFexpressions over product distributions. Building on the work of Servedio(2001), we give an algorithm that runs in time $\poly((s \cdot\log{(s/\eps)})^{\log{(s/\eps)}}, n)$, where $s$ is the size of the target DNFexpression and $\eps$ is the accuracy. This improves on $\poly((s \cdot\log{(ns/\eps)})^{\log{(s/\eps)} \cdot \log{(1/\eps)}}, n)$ bound of Servedio(2001).
arxiv-600-222 | Checking Tests for Read-Once Functions over Arbitrary Bases | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0631v3.pdf | author:Dmitry V. Chistikov category:cs.DM cs.CC cs.LG published:2012-03-03 summary:A Boolean function is called read-once over a basis B if it can be expressedby a formula over B where no variable appears more than once. A checking testfor a read-once function f over B depending on all its variables is a set ofinput vectors distinguishing f from all other read-once functions of the samevariables. We show that every read-once function f over B has a checking testcontaining O(n^l) vectors, where n is the number of relevant variables of f andl is the largest arity of functions in B. For some functions, this bound cannotbe improved by more than a constant factor. The employed technique involvesreconstructing f from its l-variable projections and provides a stronger formof Kuznetsov's classic theorem on read-once representations.
arxiv-600-223 | A Method of Moments for Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0683v3.pdf | author:Animashree Anandkumar, Daniel Hsu, Sham M. Kakade category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-03-03 summary:Mixture models are a fundamental tool in applied statistics and machinelearning for treating data taken from multiple subpopulations. The currentpractice for estimating the parameters of such models relies on local searchheuristics (e.g., the EM algorithm) which are prone to failure, and existingconsistent methods are unfavorable due to their high computational and samplecomplexity which typically scale exponentially with the number of mixturecomponents. This work develops an efficient method of moments approach toparameter estimation for a broad class of high-dimensional mixture models withmany components, including multi-view mixtures of Gaussians (such as mixturesof axis-aligned Gaussians) and hidden Markov models. The new method leads torigorous unsupervised learning results for mixture models that were notachieved by previous works; and, because of its simplicity, it offers a viablealternative to EM for practical deployment.

Inparticular, as shown by our empirical results, these algorithms consistentlyoutperform the so-called uniform combination solution that has proven to bedifficult to improve upon in the past, as well as other algorithms for learningkernels based on convex combinations of base kernels in both classification andregression. Our algorithms are based on the notion of centered alignment whichis used as a similarity measure between kernels or kernel matrices. We presenta number of novel algorithmic, theoretical, and empirical results for learningkernels based on our notion of centered alignment. In particular, we describeefficient algorithms for learning a maximum alignment kernel by showing thatthe problem can be reduced to a simple QP and discuss a one-stage algorithm forlearning both a kernel and a hypothesis based on that kernel using analignment-based regularization. Our theoretical results include a novelconcentration bound for centered alignment between kernel matrices, the proofof the existence of effective predictors for kernels with high alignment, bothfor classification and for regression, and the proof of stability-basedgeneralization bounds for a broad family of algorithms for learning kernelsbased on centered alignment. We also report the results of experiments with ourcentered alignment-based algorithms in both classification and regression.

In this paper, we present a novelstatistical change-point detection algorithm based on non-parametric divergenceestimation between time-series samples from two retrospective segments. Ourmethod uses the relative Pearson divergence as a divergence measure, and it isaccurately and efficiently estimated by a method of direct density-ratioestimation. Through experiments on artificial and real-world datasets includinghuman-activity sensing, speech, and Twitter messages, we demonstrate theusefulness of the proposed method.

The elastic-net regularization is acomposition of an $\ell_1$-regularizer for inducing the sparsity and an$\ell_2$-regularizer for controlling the smoothness. We focus on a sparsesetting where the total number of kernels is large, but the number of nonzerocomponents of the ground truth is relatively small, and show sharperconvergence rates than the learning rates have ever shown for both $\ell_1$ andelastic-net regularizations. Our analysis reveals some relations between thechoice of a regularization function and the performance. If the ground truth issmooth, we show a faster convergence rate for the elastic-net regularizationwith less conditions than $\ell_1$-regularization; otherwise, a fasterconvergence rate for the $\ell_1$-regularization is shown.

One way to analyze such data is to find invariances, orrepresentative features kept constant over changes. The aim of this paper is toidentify one such feature, namely interactions or dependencies among variablesthat are common across multiple datasets collected under different conditions.To that end, we propose a common substructure learning (CSSL) framework basedon a graphical Gaussian model. We further present a simple learning algorithmbased on the Dual Augmented Lagrangian and the Alternating Direction Method ofMultipliers. We confirm the performance of CSSL over other existing techniquesin finding unchanging dependency structures in multiple datasets throughnumerical simulations on synthetic data and through a real world application toanomaly detection in automobile sensors.

I argue that expectation-driven search heuristics aiming atfast computation resembles a high-risk decision strategy in favor of largetransition velocities. Hale's rational parser, combining generalizedleft-corner parsing with informed $\mathrm{A}^*$ search to resolve processingconflicts, explains gardenpath effects in natural sentence processing bymisleading estimates of future processing costs that are to be minimized. Onthe other hand, minimizing the duration of cognitive computations intime-continuous dynamical systems can be described by combining vector spacerepresentations of cognitive states by means of filler/role decompositions andsubsequent tensor product representations with the paradigm of stableheteroclinic sequences. Maximizing transition velocities according to ahigh-risk decision strategy could account for a fast race even between statesthat are apparently remote in representation space.

In many practical applications, such as the reverse engineeringof gene regulatory networks, not only the estimation of model parameters butthe reconstruction of the structure itself is of great interest. As well as forthe assessment of different structure learning algorithms in simulationstudies, a uniform sample from the space of directed acyclic graphs is requiredto evaluate the prevalence of certain structural features. Here we analyse howto sample acyclic digraphs uniformly at random through recursive enumeration,an approach previously thought too computationally involved. Based oncomplexity considerations, we discuss in particular how the enumerationdirectly provides an exact method, which avoids the convergence issues of thealternative Markov chain methods and is actually computationally much faster.The limiting behaviour of the distribution of acyclic digraphs then allows usto sample arbitrarily large graphs. Building on the ideas of recursiveenumeration based sampling we also introduce a novel hybrid Markov chain withmuch faster convergence than current alternatives while still being easy toadapt to various restrictions. Finally we discuss how to include suchrestrictions in the combinatorial enumeration and the new hybrid Markov chainmethod for efficient uniform sampling of the corresponding graphs.

Rather than relying on large collections of vectorialtraining examples, our framework learns using a collection of probabilitydistributions that have been constructed to meaningfully represent trainingdata. By representing these probability distributions as mean embeddings in thereproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we are able to apply many standardkernel-based learning techniques in straightforward fashion. To accomplishthis, we construct a generalization of the support vector machine (SVM) calleda support measure machine (SMM). Our analyses of SMMs provides several insightsinto their relationship to traditional SVMs. Based on such insights, we proposea flexible SVM (Flex-SVM) that places different kernel functions on eachtraining example. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datademonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

In particular, we show that from O(slog(N)) nonadaptive linearmeasurements, an image can be reconstructed to within the best s-termapproximation of its gradient up to a logarithmic factor, and this factor canbe removed by taking slightly more measurements. Along the way, we prove astrengthened Sobolev inequality for functions lying in the null space ofsuitably incoherent matrices.

Bioucas-Dias, Antonio Plaza, Nicolas Dobigeon, Mario Parente, Qian Du, Paul Gader, Jocelyn Chanussot category:math.OC stat.AP stat.ML published:2012-02-28 summary:Imaging spectrometers measure electromagnetic energy scattered in theirinstantaneous field view in hundreds or thousands of spectral channels withhigher spectral resolution than multispectral cameras. Imaging spectrometersare therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras (HSCs). Higherspectral resolution enables material identification via spectroscopic analysis,which facilitates countless applications that require identifying materials inscenarios unsuitable for classical spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatialresolution of HSCs, microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering,spectra measured by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus,accurate estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of afew materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some of:the number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their abundances ateach pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem because ofmodel inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental conditions, endmembervariability, and data set size. Researchers have devised and investigated manymodels searching for robust, stable, tractable, and accurate unmixingalgorithms. This paper presents an overview of unmixing methods from the timeof Keshava and Mustard's unmixing tutorial [1] to the present. Mixing modelsare first discussed. Signal-subspace, geometrical, statistical, sparsity-based,and spatial-contextual unmixing algorithms are described. Mathematical problemsand potential solutions are described. Algorithm characteristics areillustrated experimentally.

Majda category:cs.LG published:2012-02-28 summary:We present a technique for spatiotemporal data analysis called nonlinearLaplacian spectral analysis (NLSA), which generalizes singular spectrumanalysis (SSA) to take into account the nonlinear manifold structure of complexdata sets. The key principle underlying NLSA is that the functions used torepresent temporal patterns should exhibit a degree of smoothness on thenonlinear data manifold M; a constraint absent from classical SSA. NLSAenforces such a notion of smoothness by requiring that temporal patterns belongin low-dimensional Hilbert spaces V_l spanned by the leading l Laplace-Beltramieigenfunctions on M. These eigenfunctions can be evaluated efficiently in highambient-space dimensions using sparse graph-theoretic algorithms. Moreover,they provide orthonormal bases to expand a family of linear maps, whosesingular value decomposition leads to sets of spatiotemporal patterns atprogressively finer resolution on the data manifold. The Riemannian measure ofM and an adaptive graph kernel width enhances the capability of NLSA to detectimportant nonlinear processes, including intermittency and rare events. Theminimum dimension of V_l required to capture these features while avoidingoverfitting is estimated here using spectral entropy criteria.

Theoriginality of our work is that we propose to use the confusion matrix of aclassifier as a measure of its quality; our contribution is in the line of workwhich attempts to set up and study the statistical properties of new evaluationmeasures such as, e.g. ROC curves. In the confusion-based learning framework wepropose, we claim that a targetted objective is to minimize the size of theconfusion matrix C, measured through its operator norm C. We derivegeneralization bounds on the (size of the) confusion matrix in an extendedframework of uniform stability, adapted to the case of matrix valued loss.Pivotal to our study is a very recent matrix concentration inequality thatgeneralizes McDiarmid's inequality. As an illustration of the relevance of ourtheoretical results, we show how two SVM learning procedures can be proved tobe confusion-friendly. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is thefirst that focuses on the confusion matrix from a theoretical point of view.

We analyse a challenging problem in the area ofnon-parametric inference where an effectively infinite number of parameters hasto be learned, specifically Gaussian process regression. When the inputs arevertices on a random graph and the outputs noisy function values, we show thatreplica techniques can be used to obtain exact performance predictions in thelimit of large graphs. The covariance of the Gaussian process prior is definedby a random walk kernel, the discrete analogue of squared exponential kernelson continuous spaces. Conventionally this kernel is normalised only globally,so that the prior variance can differ between vertices; as a more principledalternative we consider local normalisation, where the prior variance isuniform.
arxiv-600-238 | Divide-and-Conquer Method for L1 Norm Matrix Factorization in the Presence of Outliers and Missing Data | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5844v3.pdf | author:Deyu Meng, Zongben Xu category:cs.NA cs.CV published:2012-02-27 summary:The low-rank matrix factorization as a L1 norm minimization problem hasrecently attracted much attention due to its intrinsic robustness to thepresence of outliers and missing data. In this paper, we propose a new method,called the divide-and-conquer method, for solving this problem. The main ideais to break the original problem into a series of smallest possiblesub-problems, each involving only unique scalar parameter. Each of thesesubproblems is proved to be convex and has closed-form solution. By recursivelyoptimizing these small problems in an analytical way, efficient algorithm,entirely avoiding the time-consuming numerical optimization as an inner loop,for solving the original problem can naturally be constructed. Thecomputational complexity of the proposed algorithm is approximately linear inboth data size and dimensionality, making it possible to handle large-scale L1norm matrix factorization problems. The algorithm is also theoretically provedto be convergent. Based on a series of experiment results, it is substantiatedthat our method always achieves better results than the currentstate-of-the-art methods on $L1$ matrix factorization calculation in bothcomputational time and accuracy, especially on large-scale applications such asface recognition and structure from motion.

We are interested in application scenarioswhere concurrent function evaluations are possible. Under such a setting, BOcould choose to either sequentially evaluate the function, one input at a timeand wait for the output of the function before making the next selection, orevaluate the function at a batch of multiple inputs at once. These twodifferent settings are commonly referred to as the sequential and batchsettings of Bayesian Optimization. In general, the sequential setting leads tobetter optimization performance as each function evaluation is selected withmore information, whereas the batch setting has an advantage in terms of thetotal experimental time (the number of iterations). In this work, our goal isto combine the strength of both settings. Specifically, we systematicallyanalyze Bayesian optimization using Gaussian process as the posterior estimatorand provide a hybrid algorithm that, based on the current state, dynamicallyswitches between a sequential policy and a batch policy with variable batchsizes. We provide theoretical justification for our algorithm and presentexperimental results on eight benchmark BO problems. The results show that ourmethod achieves substantial speedup (up to %78) compared to a pure sequentialpolicy, without suffering any significant performance loss.

Adams, Hugo Larochelle category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-02-25 summary:The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a flexible tool for modelingcomplex data, however there have been significant computational difficulties inusing RBMs to model high-dimensional multinomial observations. In naturallanguage processing applications, words are naturally modeled by K-ary discretedistributions, where K is determined by the vocabulary size and can easily bein the hundreds of thousands. The conventional approach to training RBMs onword observations is limited because it requires sampling the states of K-waysoftmax visible units during block Gibbs updates, an operation that takes timelinear in K. In this work, we address this issue by employing a more generalclass of Markov chain Monte Carlo operators on the visible units, yieldingupdates with computational complexity independent of K. We demonstrate thesuccess of our approach by training RBMs on hundreds of millions of wordn-grams using larger vocabularies than previously feasible and using thelearned features to improve performance on chunking and sentimentclassification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the latter.

In such situation, it is not possibleto build a powerful classifier by using standard methods such as logisticregression, classification tree, discriminant analysis, etc. To overcome thisshort-coming of these methods which yield classifiers with low sensibility, wetackled the classification problem here through an approach based on theassociation rules learning. This approach has the advantage of allowing theidentification of the patterns that are well correlated with the target class.Association rules learning is a well known method in the area of data-mining.It is used when dealing with large database for unsupervised discovery of localpatterns that expresses hidden relationships between input variables. Inconsidering association rules from a supervised learning point of view, arelevant set of weak classifiers is obtained from which one derives aclassifier that performs well.

Our minimaxoptimal test is based on a sparse eigenvalue statistic. Alas, computing thistest is known to be NP-complete in general, and we describe a computationallyefficient alternative test using convex relaxations. Our relaxation is alsoproved to detect sparse principal components at near optimal detection levels,and it performs well on simulated datasets. Moreover, using polynomial timereductions from theoretical computer science, we bring significant evidencethat our results cannot be improved, thus revealing an inherent trade offbetween statistical and computational performance.

Although decision-making by individual neuronshas been extensively studied, questions regarding how neurons should behave tocooperate effectively remain largely unaddressed. Under assumptions thatcapture a few basic features of cortical neurons, we show that constrainingreward maximization by metabolic cost aligns the information content of actionswith their expected reward. Thus, metabolic cost provides a mechanism wherebyneurons encode expected reward into their outputs. Further, aside from reducingenergy expenditures, imposing a tight metabolic constraint also increases theaccuracy of empirical estimates of rewards, increasing the robustness ofdistributed learning. Finally, we present two implementations of metabolicallyconstrained learning that confirm our theoretical finding. These resultssuggest that metabolic cost may be an organizing principle underlying theneural code, and may also provide a useful guide to the design and analysis ofother cooperating populations.

Gray category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-02-18 summary:The goal of predictive sparse coding is to learn a representation of examplesas sparse linear combinations of elements from a dictionary, such that alearned hypothesis linear in the new representation performs well on apredictive task. Predictive sparse coding algorithms recently have demonstratedimpressive performance on a variety of supervised tasks, but theirgeneralization properties have not been studied. We establish the firstgeneralization error bounds for predictive sparse coding, covering twosettings: 1) the overcomplete setting, where the number of features k exceedsthe original dimensionality d; and 2) the high or infinite-dimensional setting,where only dimension-free bounds are useful. Both learning bounds intimatelydepend on stability properties of the learned sparse encoder, as measured onthe training sample. Consequently, we first present a fundamental stabilityresult for the LASSO, a result characterizing the stability of the sparse codeswith respect to perturbations to the dictionary. In the overcomplete setting,we present an estimation error bound that decays as \tilde{O}(sqrt(d k/m)) withrespect to d and k. In the high or infinite-dimensional setting, we show adimension-free bound that is \tilde{O}(sqrt(k^2 s / m)) with respect to k ands, where s is an upper bound on the number of non-zeros in the sparse code forany training data point.

arxiv-600-250 | Guaranteed clustering and biclustering via semidefinite programming | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.3663v6.pdf | author:Brendan P. W. Ames category:math.OC cs.LG published:2012-02-16 summary:Identifying clusters of similar objects in data plays a significant role in awide range of applications. As a model problem for clustering, we consider thedensest k-disjoint-clique problem, whose goal is to identify the collection ofk disjoint cliques of a given weighted complete graph maximizing the sum of thedensities of the complete subgraphs induced by these cliques. In this paper, weestablish conditions ensuring exact recovery of the densest k cliques of agiven graph from the optimal solution of a particular semidefinite program. Inparticular, the semidefinite relaxation is exact for input graphs correspondingto data consisting of k large, distinct clusters and a smaller number ofoutliers. This approach also yields a semidefinite relaxation for thebiclustering problem with similar recovery guarantees. Given a set of objectsand a set of features exhibited by these objects, biclustering seeks tosimultaneously group the objects and features according to their expressionlevels. This problem may be posed as partitioning the nodes of a weightedbipartite complete graph such that the sum of the densities of the resultingbipartite complete subgraphs is maximized. As in our analysis of the densestk-disjoint-clique problem, we show that the correct partition of the objectsand features can be recovered from the optimal solution of a semidefiniteprogram in the case that the given data consists of several disjoint sets ofobjects exhibiting similar features. Empirical evidence from numericalexperiments supporting these theoretical guarantees is also provided.

The goal is to minimize the number of tossesuntil we identify a coin i* whose posterior probability of being most biased isat least 1-delta for a given delta. Under a particular probabilistic model, wegive an optimal algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that minimizes the expectednumber of future tosses. The problem is closely related to finding the best armin the multi-armed bandit problem using adaptive strategies. Our algorithmemploys an optimal adaptive strategy -- a strategy that performs the bestpossible action at each step after observing the outcomes of all previous cointosses. Consequently, our algorithm is also optimal for any starting history ofoutcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that employs an optimaladaptive strategy under a Bayesian setting for this problem. Our proof ofoptimality employs tools from the field of Markov games.

At the heart of PCA is the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem,which characterizes the best rank k approximation of a matrix. In this paper,we prove a generalization of the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem under allunitarily invariant norms. Using this result, we obtain closed-form solutionsfor a set of rank/norm regularized problems, and derive closed-form solutionsfor a general class of subspace clustering problems (where data is modelled byunions of unknown subspaces). From these results we obtain new theoreticalinsights and promising experimental results.

Our primary example of the target matrix is the inverse of a populationcovariance or correlation matrix. The algorithm first estimates each column ofthe target matrix by the scaled Lasso and then adjusts the matrix estimator tobe symmetric. The penalty level of the scaled Lasso for each column iscompletely determined by data via convex minimization, without usingcross-validation. We prove that this scaled Lasso method guarantees the fastest proven rate ofconvergence in the spectrum norm under conditions of weaker form than those inthe existing analyses of other $\ell_1$ regularized algorithms, and has fasterguaranteed rate of convergence when the ratio of the $\ell_1$ and spectrumnorms of the target inverse matrix diverges to infinity. A simulation studydemonstrates the computational feasibility and superb performance of theproposed method. Our analysis also provides new performance bounds for the Lasso and scaledLasso to guarantee higher concentration of the error at a smaller thresholdlevel than previous analyses, and to allow the use of the union bound incolumn-by-column applications of the scaled Lasso without an adjustment of thepenalty level. In addition, the least squares estimation after the scaled Lassoselection is considered and proven to guarantee performance bounds similar tothat of the scaled Lasso.
arxiv-600-255 | Multi-Level Error-Resilient Neural Networks with Learning | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2770v4.pdf | author:Amir Hesam Salavati, Amin Karbasi category:cs.NE cs.AI cs.IT math.IT published:2012-02-13 summary:The problem of neural network association is to retrieve a previouslymemorized pattern from its noisy version using a network of neurons. An idealneural network should include three components simultaneously: a learningalgorithm, a large pattern retrieval capacity and resilience against noise.Prior works in this area usually improve one or two aspects at the cost of thethird. Our work takes a step forward in closing this gap. More specifically, we showthat by forcing natural constraints on the set of learning patterns, we candrastically improve the retrieval capacity of our neural network. Moreover, wedevise a learning algorithm whose role is to learn those patterns satisfyingthe above mentioned constraints. Finally we show that our neural network cancope with a fair amount of noise.

Fern√°ndez-Leiva category:cs.AI astro-ph.IM cs.NE published:2012-02-12 summary:In general Evolutionary Computation (EC) includes a number of optimizationmethods inspired by biological mechanisms of evolution. The methods cataloguedin this area use the Darwinian principles of life evolution to producealgorithms that returns high quality solutions to hard-to-solve optimizationproblems. The main strength of EC is precisely that they provide good solutionseven if the computational resources (e.g., running time) are limited. Astronomyand Astrophysics are two fields that often require optimizing problems of highcomplexity or analyzing a huge amount of data and the so-called completeoptimization methods are inherently limited by the size of the problem/data.For instance, reliable analysis of large amounts of data is central to modernastrophysics and astronomical sciences in general. EC techniques perform wellwhere other optimization methods are inherently limited (as complete methodsapplied to NP-hard problems), and in the last ten years, numerous proposalshave come up that apply with greater or lesser success methodologies ofevolutional computation to common engineering problems. Some of these problems,such as the estimation of non-lineal parameters, the development of automaticlearning techniques, the implementation of control systems, or the resolutionof multi-objective optimization problems, have had (and have) a specialrepercussion in the fields. For these reasons EC emerges as a feasiblealternative for traditional methods. In this paper, we discuss some promisingapplications in this direction and a number of recent works in this area; thepaper also includes a general description of EC to provide a global perspectiveto the reader and gives some guidelines of application of EC techniques forfuture research

Hand, Christoforos Anagnostopoulos category:stat.ME cs.CV stat.ML published:2012-02-12 summary:The area under the ROC curve is widely used as a measure of performance ofclassification rules. However, it has recently been shown that the measure isfundamentally incoherent, in the sense that it treats the relative severitiesof misclassifications differently when different classifiers are used. Toovercome this, Hand (2009) proposed the $H$ measure, which allows a givenresearcher to fix the distribution of relative severities to aclassifier-independent setting on a given problem. This note extends thediscussion, and proposes a modified standard distribution for the $H$ measure,which better matches the requirements of researchers, in particular those facedwith heavily unbalanced datasets, the $Beta(\pi_1+1,\pi_0+1)$ distribution.[Preprint submitted at Pattern Recognition Letters]
arxiv-600-259 | High Dimensional Semiparametric Gaussian Copula Graphical Models | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2169v3.pdf | author:Han Liu, Fang Han, Ming Yuan, John Lafferty, Larry Wasserman category:stat.ML published:2012-02-10 summary:In this paper, we propose a semiparametric approach, named nonparanormalskeptic, for efficiently and robustly estimating high dimensional undirectedgraphical models. To achieve modeling flexibility, we consider Gaussian Copulagraphical models (or the nonparanormal) as proposed by Liu et al. (2009). Toachieve estimation robustness, we exploit nonparametric rank-based correlationcoefficient estimators, including Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. In highdimensional settings, we prove that the nonparanormal skeptic achieves theoptimal parametric rate of convergence in both graph and parameter estimation.This celebrating result suggests that the Gaussian copula graphical models canbe used as a safe replacement of the popular Gaussian graphical models, evenwhen the data are truly Gaussian. Besides theoretical analysis, we also conductthorough numerical simulations to compare different estimators for their graphrecovery performance under both ideal and noisy settings. The proposed methodsare then applied on a large-scale genomic dataset to illustrate their empiricalusefulness. The R language software package huge implementing the proposedmethods is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network: http://cran.r-project.org/.
arxiv-600-260 | Scene Parsing with Multiscale Feature Learning, Purity Trees, and Optimal Covers | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2160v2.pdf | author:Cl√©ment Farabet, Camille Couprie, Laurent Najman, Yann LeCun category:cs.CV cs.LG published:2012-02-10 summary:Scene parsing, or semantic segmentation, consists in labeling each pixel inan image with the category of the object it belongs to. It is a challengingtask that involves the simultaneous detection, segmentation and recognition ofall the objects in the image. The scene parsing method proposed here starts by computing a tree of segmentsfrom a graph of pixel dissimilarities. Simultaneously, a set of dense featurevectors is computed which encodes regions of multiple sizes centered on eachpixel. The feature extractor is a multiscale convolutional network trained fromraw pixels. The feature vectors associated with the segments covered by eachnode in the tree are aggregated and fed to a classifier which produces anestimate of the distribution of object categories contained in the segment. Asubset of tree nodes that cover the image are then selected so as to maximizethe average "purity" of the class distributions, hence maximizing the overalllikelihood that each segment will contain a single object. The convolutionalnetwork feature extractor is trained end-to-end from raw pixels, alleviatingthe need for engineered features. After training, the system is parameter free. The system yields record accuracies on the Stanford Background Dataset (8classes), the Sift Flow Dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona Dataset (170classes) while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches,producing a 320 \times 240 image labeling in less than 1 second.

It is useful not only when a discrete result, such as featureextraction or surface type, is required, but also for continuum retrievals bydividing the quantity of interest into discrete ranges. Because of the highresolution of modern satellite instruments and because of the requirement forreal-time processing, any algorithm has to be fast to be useful. Here wedescribe an algorithm based on kernel estimation called Adaptive GaussianFiltering that incorporates several innovations to produce superior efficiencyas compared to three other popular methods: k-nearest-neighbour (KNN), LearningVector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This efficiency isgained with no compromises: accuracy is maintained, while estimates of theconditional probabilities are returned. These are useful not only to gauge theaccuracy of an estimate in the absence of its true value, but also tore-calibrate a retrieved image and as a proxy for a discretized continuumvariable. The algorithm is demonstrated and compared with the other three on apair of synthetic test classes and to map the waterways of the Netherlands.Software may be found at: http://libagf.sourceforge.net.

Eldar, Zvi Friedman category:cs.IT cs.CV math.IT published:2012-02-09 summary:Emerging sonography techniques often require increasing the number oftransducer elements involved in the imaging process. Consequently, largeramounts of data must be acquired and processed. The significant growth in theamounts of data affects both machinery size and power consumption. Within theclassical sampling framework, state of the art systems reduce processing ratesby exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected signals. It has beenrecently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate reduction may beobtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite Rate of Innovationframework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which combines classicmethods from sampling theory with recent developments in Compressed Sensing.Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual transducer elements,which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is limited by the noisynature of the signals. This often results in erroneous parameter extraction,bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the low-rate samples. In ourwork, we achieve SNR enhancement, by beamforming the sub-Nyquist samplesobtained from multiple elements. We refer to this process as "compressedbeamforming". Applying it to cardiac ultrasound data, we successfully imagemacroscopic perturbations, while achieving a nearly eight-fold reduction insample-rate, compared to standard techniques.

In this paper we consider higher dimensional extensions of thesentiment concept, which represent a richer set of human emotions. Our approachgoes beyond previous work in that our model contains a continuous manifoldrather than a finite set of human emotions. We investigate the resulting model,compare it to psychological observations, and explore its predictivecapabilities. Besides obtaining significant improvements over a baselinewithout manifold, we are also able to visualize different notions of positivesentiment in different domains.

We introduce a recently proposed inferenceframework that combines belief propagation (BP) and the mean field (MF)approximation and includes these algorithms as special cases. We also show thatthe expectation propagation and expectation maximization algorithms can beembedded in the BP-MF framework with slight modifications. By applying theconsidered inference algorithms to our probabilistic model, we derive fourdifferent message-passing receiver schemes. Our numerical evaluationdemonstrates that the receiver based on the BP-MF framework and its variantbased on BP-EM yield the best compromise between performance, computationalcomplexity and numerical stability among all candidate algorithms.

Our fully automaticapproach does not require any manually placed markers on the scan. Instead, theapproach learns the locations of a set of landmarks present in a database anduses this knowledge to automatically predict the locations of these landmarkson a newly available scan. The predicted landmarks are then used to computepoint-to-point correspondences between a template model and the newly availablescan. To accurately fit the expression of the template to the expression of thescan, we use as template a blendshape model. Our algorithm was tested on adatabase of human faces of different ethnic groups with strongly varyingexpressions. Experimental results show that the obtained point-to-pointcorrespondence is both highly accurate and consistent for most of the tested 3Dface models.

Murthy category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-02-06 summary:In this paper, we derive Hybrid, Bayesian and Marginalized Cram\'{e}r-Raolower bounds (HCRB, BCRB and MCRB) for the single and multiple measurementvector Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) problem of estimating compressiblevectors and their prior distribution parameters. We assume the unknown vectorto be drawn from a compressible Student-t prior distribution. We derive CRBsthat encompass the deterministic or random nature of the unknown parameters ofthe prior distribution and the regression noise variance. We extend the MCRB tothe case where the compressible vector is distributed according to a generalcompressible prior distribution, of which the generalized Pareto distributionis a special case. We use the derived bounds to uncover the relationshipbetween the compressibility and Mean Square Error (MSE) in the estimates.Further, we illustrate the tightness and utility of the bounds throughsimulations, by comparing them with the MSE performance of two popularSBL-based estimators. It is found that the MCRB is generally the tightest amongthe bounds derived and that the MSE performance of the Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm coincides with the MCRB for the compressible vector. Throughsimulations, we demonstrate the dependence of the MSE performance of SBL basedestimators on the compressibility of the vector for several values of thenumber of observations and at different signal powers.

Codewords are linear combinations ofsubsets of columns of a design matrix. Called a Sparse Superposition or SparseRegression codebook, this structure is motivated by an analogous constructionproposed recently by Barron and Joseph for communication over an AWGN channel.For i.i.d Gaussian sources and minimum-distance encoding, we show that such acode can attain the Shannon rate-distortion function with the optimal errorexponent, for all distortions below a specified value. It is also shown thatsparse regression codes are robust in the following sense: a codebook designedto compress an i.i.d Gaussian source of variance $\sigma^2$ with(squared-error) distortion $D$ can compress any ergodic source of variance lessthan $\sigma^2$ to within distortion $D$. Thus the sparse regression ensembleretains many of the good covering properties of the i.i.d random Gaussianensemble, while having having a compact representation in terms of a matrixwhose size is a low-order polynomial in the block-length.

Xing, Masashi Sugiyama category:stat.ML cs.AI stat.ME published:2012-02-02 summary:The goal of supervised feature selection is to find a subset of inputfeatures that are responsible for predicting output values. The least absoluteshrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) allows computationally efficientfeature selection based on linear dependency between input features and outputvalues. In this paper, we consider a feature-wise kernelized Lasso forcapturing non-linear input-output dependency. We first show that, withparticular choices of kernel functions, non-redundant features with strongstatistical dependence on output values can be found in terms of kernel-basedindependence measures. We then show that the globally optimal solution can beefficiently computed; this makes the approach scalable to high-dimensionalproblems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated throughfeature selection experiments with thousands of features.

Sutherland, Liang Xiong, Barnab√°s P√≥czos, Jeff Schneider category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-02-01 summary:Most machine learning algorithms, such as classification or regression, treatthe individual data point as the object of interest. Here we consider extendingmachine learning algorithms to operate on groups of data points. We suggesttreating a group of data points as an i.i.d. sample set from an underlyingfeature distribution for that group. Our approach employs kernel machines witha kernel on i.i.d. sample sets of vectors. We define certain kernel functionson pairs of distributions, and then use a nonparametric estimator toconsistently estimate those functions based on sample sets. The projection ofthe estimated Gram matrix to the cone of symmetric positive semi-definitematrices enables us to use kernel machines for classification, regression,anomaly detection, and low-dimensional embedding in the space of distributions.We present several numerical experiments both on real and simulated datasets todemonstrate the advantages of our new approach.

Holyst category:physics.soc-ph cs.CL cs.SI published:2012-01-26 summary:We performed statistical analysis on data from the Digg.com website, whichenables its users to express their opinion on news stories by taking part inforum-like discussions as well as directly evaluate previous posts and storiesby assigning so called "diggs". Owing to fact that the content of each post hasbeen annotated with its emotional value, apart from the strictly structuralproperties, the study also includes an analysis of the average emotionalresponse of the posts commenting the main story. While analysing correlationsat the story level, an interesting relationship between the number of diggs andthe number of comments received by a story was found. The correlation betweenthe two quantities is high for data where small threads dominate andconsistently decreases for longer threads. However, while the correlation ofthe number of diggs and the average emotional response tends to grow for longerthreads, correlations between numbers of comments and the average emotionalresponse are almost zero. We also show that the initial set of comments givento a story has a substantial impact on the further "life" of the discussion:high negative average emotions in the first 10 comments lead to longer threadswhile the opposite situation results in shorter discussions. We also suggestpresence of two different mechanisms governing the evolution of the discussionand, consequently, its length.

arxiv-600-276 | On Constrained Spectral Clustering and Its Applications | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5338v2.pdf | author:Xiang Wang, Buyue Qian, Ian Davidson category:cs.LG stat.ML H.2.8 published:2012-01-25 summary:Constrained clustering has been well-studied for algorithms such as $K$-meansand hierarchical clustering. However, how to satisfy many constraints in thesealgorithmic settings has been shown to be intractable. One alternative toencode many constraints is to use spectral clustering, which remains adeveloping area. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for constrainedspectral clustering. In contrast to some previous efforts that implicitlyencode Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints by modifying the graph Laplacianor constraining the underlying eigenspace, we present a more natural andprincipled formulation, which explicitly encodes the constraints as part of aconstrained optimization problem. Our method offers several practicaladvantages: it can encode the degree of belief in Must-Link and Cannot-Linkconstraints; it guarantees to lower-bound how well the given constraints aresatisfied using a user-specified threshold; it can be solved deterministicallyin polynomial time through generalized eigendecomposition. Furthermore, byinheriting the objective function from spectral clustering and encoding theconstraints explicitly, much of the existing analysis of unconstrained spectralclustering techniques remains valid for our formulation. We validate theeffectiveness of our approach by empirical results on both artificial and realdatasets. We also demonstrate an innovative use of encoding large number ofconstraints: transfer learning via constraints.

Previousstudies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth lossfunction or a strongly convex regularizer, making them unsuitable fornon-smooth optimization. We develop a simple yet efficient method for a familyof non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function isbilinear in primal and dual variables. We cast a non-smooth optimizationproblem into a minimax optimization problem, and develop a primal dual proxmethod that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of $O(1/T)${assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved}, significantlyfaster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$convergence rate. Our empirical study verifies the efficiency of the proposedmethod for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously inmachine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods.
arxiv-600-278 | A probabilistic methodology for multilabel classification | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.4777v2.pdf | author:Alfonso E. Romero, Luis M. de Campos category:cs.AI cs.LG 68T37, 68T10 published:2012-01-23 summary:Multilabel classification is a relatively recent subfield of machinelearning. Unlike to the classical approach, where instances are labeled withonly one category, in multilabel classification, an arbitrary number ofcategories is chosen to label an instance. Due to the problem complexity (thesolution is one among an exponential number of alternatives), a very commonsolution (the binary method) is frequently used, learning a binary classifierfor every category, and combining them all afterwards. The assumption taken inthis solution is not realistic, and in this work we give examples where thedecisions for all the labels are not taken independently, and thus, asupervised approach should learn those existing relationships among categoriesto make a better classification. Therefore, we show here a generic methodologythat can improve the results obtained by a set of independent probabilisticbinary classifiers, by using a combination procedure with a classifier trainedon the co-occurrences of the labels. We show an exhaustive experimentation inthree different standard corpora of labeled documents (Reuters-21578,Ohsumed-23 and RCV1), which present noticeable improvements in all of them,when using our methodology, in three probabilistic base classifiers.

Despite significant progress in the theory andmethods of CS, little headway has been made in compressive video acquisitionand recovery. Video CS is complicated by the ephemeral nature of dynamicevents, which makes direct extensions of standard CS imaging architectures andsignal models difficult. In this paper, we develop a new framework for video CSfor dynamic textured scenes that models the evolution of the scene as a lineardynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to firstestimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, andthen reconstructing the image frames. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamicparameters (the state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (theobservation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurementstrategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant andaccumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. Thisenables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably. We validateour approach with a range of experiments involving both video recovery, sensinghyper-spectral data, and classification of dynamic scenes from compressivedata. Together, these applications demonstrate the effectiveness of theapproach.

In particular, learning is usually performed in two separate steps.First, the graph structure is learned from the data; then the parameters of themodel are estimated conditional on that graph structure. While the probabilitydistributions involved in this second step have been studied in depth, the onesused in the first step have not been explored in as much detail. In this paper, we will study the prior and posterior distributions definedover the space of the graph structures for the purpose of learning thestructure of a graphical model. In particular, we will provide acharacterisation of the behaviour of those distributions as a function of thepossible edges of the graph. We will then use the properties resulting fromthis characterisation to define measures of structural variability for bothBayesian and Markov networks, and we will point out some of their possibleapplications.

This method is based onsplitting the Hamiltonian in a way that allows much of the movement around thestate space to be done at low computational cost. To this end, we approximatethe negative log density (i.e., the energy function) of the distribution ofinterest by a quadratic function U0 for which Hamiltonian dynamics can besolved analytically. The overall energy function U is then written as U0 + U1,where U1 is the approximation error. The Hamiltonian is then split into twoparts; one part is based on U0 is handled analytically, the other part is basedon U1 for which we approximate Hamiltonian's equations by discretizing time. Weuse simulated and real data to compare the performance of our method to thestandard HMC. We find that splitting the Hamiltonian for GP models could leadto substantial improvement (up to 10 folds) of sampling efficiency, which ismeasured in terms of the amount of time required for producing an independentsample with high acceptance probability from posterior distributions.

We use coherent andmeaningful collections of nearly 1000 texts to show how we can measure inherentultrametricity. On the basis of our findings we hypothesize that inherentultrametricty is a basis for further exploring unconscious thought processes.

Our approach, therefore, has to learn characterrepresentations without supervision and requires a mechanism to distinguishlearned representations from irregular patterns. To learn characterrepresentations, we use a probabilistic generative model parameterizing patternfeatures, feature variances, the features' planar arrangements, and patternfrequencies. The latent variables of the model describe pattern class, patternposition, and the presence or absence of individual pattern features. The modelparameters are optimized using a novel variational EM approximation. Afterlearning, the parameters represent, independently of their absolute position,planar feature arrangements and their variances. A quality measure definedbased on the learned representation then allows for an autonomousdiscrimination between regular character patterns and the irregular patternsmaking up the dirt. The irregular patterns can thus be removed to clean thedocument. For a full Latin alphabet we found that a single page does notcontain sufficiently many character examples. However, even if heavilycorrupted by dirt, we show that a page containing a lower number of charactertypes can efficiently and autonomously be cleaned solely based on thestructural regularity of the characters it contains. In different examplesusing characters from different alphabets, we demonstrate generality of theapproach and discuss its implications for future developments.
arxiv-600-284 | Sparse Reward Processes | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.2555v2.pdf | author:Christos Dimitrakakis category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-01-12 summary:We introduce a class of learning problems where the agent is presented with aseries of tasks. Intuitively, if there is relation among those tasks, then theinformation gained during execution of one task has value for the execution ofanother task. Consequently, the agent is intrinsically motivated to explore itsenvironment beyond the degree necessary to solve the current task it has athand. We develop a decision theoretic setting that generalises standardreinforcement learning tasks and captures this intuition. More precisely, weconsider a multi-stage stochastic game between a learning agent and anopponent. We posit that the setting is a good model for the problem oflife-long learning in uncertain environments, where while resources must bespent learning about currently important tasks, there is also the need toallocate effort towards learning about aspects of the world which are notrelevant at the moment. This is due to the fact that unpredictable futureevents may lead to a change of priorities for the decision maker. Thus, in somesense, the model "explains" the necessity of curiosity. Apart from introducingthe general formalism, the paper provides algorithms. These are evaluatedexperimentally in some exemplary domains. In addition, performance bounds areproven for some cases of this problem.

However, to achieve this aim, itcauses the force constructed from the heat diffusion model unable to indicatethe object boundaries accurately. The image force based on electrostatic fieldmodel can perform an exact shape recovery. First, this study introduces afusion scheme of these two image forces, which is capable of extracting theobject boundary with high precision and fast speed. Until now, there is nosatisfied analysis about the relationship between Snakes and Geometric ActiveContours (GAC). The second contribution of this study addresses that the GACmodel can be deduced directly from Snakes model. It proves that each term inGAC and Snakes is correspondent and has similar function. However, the twomodels are expressed using different mathematics. Further, since losing theability of rotating the contour, adoption of level sets can limits the usage ofGAC in some circumstances.
arxiv-600-286 | A Thermodynamical Approach for Probability Estimation | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.1384v2.pdf | author:Takashi Isozaki category:cs.LG stat.ME published:2012-01-06 summary:The issue of discrete probability estimation for samples of small size isaddressed in this study. The maximum likelihood method often suffersover-fitting when insufficient data is available. Although the Bayesianapproach can avoid over-fitting by using prior distributions, it still hasproblems with objective analysis. In response to these drawbacks, a newtheoretical framework based on thermodynamics, where energy and temperature areintroduced, was developed. Entropy and likelihood are placed at the center ofthis method. The key principle of inference for probability mass functions isthe minimum free energy, which is shown to unify the two principles of maximumlikelihood and maximum entropy. Our method can robustly estimate probabilityfunctions from small size data.
arxiv-600-287 | Extension of SBL Algorithms for the Recovery of Block Sparse Signals with Intra-Block Correlation | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.0862v5.pdf | author:Zhilin Zhang, Bhaskar D. Rao category:stat.ML stat.ME published:2012-01-04 summary:We examine the recovery of block sparse signals and extend the framework intwo important directions; one by exploiting signals' intra-block correlationand the other by generalizing signals' block structure. We propose two familiesof algorithms based on the framework of block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL).One family, directly derived from the BSBL framework, requires knowledge of theblock structure. Another family, derived from an expanded BSBL framework, isbased on a weaker assumption on the block structure, and can be used when theblock structure is completely unknown. Using these algorithms we show thatexploiting intra-block correlation is very helpful in improving recoveryperformance. These algorithms also shed light on how to modify existingalgorithms or design new ones to exploit such correlation and improveperformance.

This paper introduces a topic modeling toolbox (TMBP)based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithms. TMBP toolbox is implemented byMEX C++/Matlab/Octave for either Windows 7 or Linux. Compared with existingtopic modeling packages, the novelty of this toolbox lies in the BP algorithmsfor learning LDA-based topic models. The current version includes BP algorithmsfor latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), author-topic models (ATM), relationaltopic models (RTM), and labeled LDA (LaLDA). This toolbox is an ongoing projectand more BP-based algorithms for various topic models will be added in the nearfuture. Interested users may also extend BP algorithms for learning morecomplicated topic models.

arxiv-600-289 | Sparse Nonparametric Graphical Models | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.0794v2.pdf | author:John Lafferty, Han Liu, Larry Wasserman category:stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME published:2012-01-04 summary:We present some nonparametric methods for graphical modeling. In the discretecase, where the data are binary or drawn from a finite alphabet, Markov randomfields are already essentially nonparametric, since the cliques can take only afinite number of values. Continuous data are different. The Gaussian graphicalmodel is the standard parametric model for continuous data, but it makesdistributional assumptions that are often unrealistic. We discuss twoapproaches to building more flexible graphical models. One allows arbitrarygraphs and a nonparametric extension of the Gaussian; the other uses kerneldensity estimation and restricts the graphs to trees and forests. Examples ofboth methods are presented. We also discuss possible future research directionsfor nonparametric graphical modeling.

Wepropose a novel Joint Basis Pursuit (JBP) algorithm that finds related sparsefeatures in two modalities using conic programming and integrate it into atwo-step dictionary learning algorithm. JBP differs from related convexalgorithms because it finds joint sparsity models with different atoms anddifferent coefficient values for intensity and depth. This is crucial forrecovering generative models where the same sparse underlying causes (3Dfeatures) give rise to different signals (intensity and depth). We give atheoretical bound for the sparse coefficient recovery error obtained by JBP,and show experimentally that JBP is far superior to the state of the art GroupLasso algorithm. When applied to the Middlebury depth-intensity database, ourlearning algorithm converges to a set of related features, such as pairs ofdepth and intensity edges or image textures and depth slants. Finally, we showthat the learned dictionary and JBP achieve the state of the art depthinpainting performance on time-of-flight 3D data.

Le, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Rajat Monga, Matthieu Devin, Kai Chen, Greg S. Corrado, Jeff Dean, Andrew Y. Ng category:cs.LG published:2011-12-29 summary:We consider the problem of building high- level, class-specific featuredetectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a facedetector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layeredlocally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrastnormalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 bil- lionconnections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded fromthe Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronousSGD on a clus- ter with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contraryto what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental re- sultsreveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to labelimages as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this featuredetector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-planerotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-levelconcepts such as cat faces and human bod- ies. Starting with these learnedfeatures, we trained our network to obtain 15.8% accu- racy in recognizing20,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70% relative im- provementover the previous state-of-the-art.

An iterative mixed $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ convex program isused to estimate the true state by locally linearizing the nonlinearmeasurements. When the measurements are linear, through using the almostEuclidean property for a linear subspace, we derive a new performance bound forthe state estimation error under sparse bad data and additive observationnoise. As a byproduct, in this paper we provide sharp bounds on the almostEuclidean property of a linear subspace, using the "escape-through-the-mesh"theorem from geometric functional analysis. When the measurements arenonlinear, we give conditions under which the solution of the iterativealgorithm converges to the true state even though the locally linearizedmeasurements may not be the actual nonlinear measurements. We numericallyevaluate our iterative convex programming approach to perform bad datadetections in nonlinear electrical power networks problems. We are able to usesemidefinite programming to verify the conditions for convergence of theproposed iterative sparse recovery algorithms from nonlinear measurements.
arxiv-600-294 | Multispectral Palmprint Recognition Using a Hybrid Feature | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.5997v3.pdf | author:Sina Akbari Mistani, Shervin Minaee, Emad Fatemizadeh category:cs.CV published:2011-12-27 summary:Personal identification problem has been a major field of research in recentyears. Biometrics-based technologies that exploit fingerprints, iris, face,voice and palmprints, have been in the center of attention to solve thisproblem. Palmprints can be used instead of fingerprints that have been of theearliest of these biometrics technologies. A palm is covered with the same skinas the fingertips but has a larger surface, giving us more information than thefingertips. The major features of the palm are palm-lines, including principallines, wrinkles and ridges. Using these lines is one of the most popularapproaches towards solving the palmprint recognition problem. Another robustfeature is the wavelet energy of palms. In this paper we used a hybrid featurewhich combines both of these features. %Moreover, multispectral analysis isapplied to improve the performance of the system. At the end, minimum distanceclassifier is used to match test images with one of the training samples. Theproposed algorithm has been tested on a well-known multispectral palmprintdataset and achieved an average accuracy of 98.8\%.
arxiv-600-295 | Search space analysis with Wang-Landau sampling and slow adaptive walks | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.5980v2.pdf | author:Susan Khor category:cs.NE published:2011-12-27 summary:Two complementary techniques for analyzing search spaces are proposed: (i) analgorithm to detect search points with potential to be local optima; and (ii) aslightly adjusted Wang-Landau sampling algorithm to explore larger searchspaces. The detection algorithm assumes that local optima are points which areeasier to reach and harder to leave by a slow adaptive walker. A slow adaptivewalker moves to a nearest fitter point. Thus, points with larger outgoing stepsizes relative to incoming step sizes are marked using the local optima scoreformulae as potential local optima points (PLOPs). Defining local optima inthese more general terms allows their detection within the closure of a subsetof a search space, and the sampling of a search space unshackled by aparticular move set. Tests are done with NK and HIFF problems to confirm thatPLOPs detected in the manner proposed retain characteristics of local optima,and that the adjusted Wang-Landau samples are more representative of the searchspace than samples produced by choosing points uniformly at random. While ourapproach shows promise, more needs to be done to reduce its computation costthat it may pave a way toward analyzing larger search spaces of practicalmeaning.

In this paper,we study the problem of learning smooth pattern transformation manifolds fromimage sets that represent observations of geometrically transformed signals. Inorder to construct a manifold, we build a representative pattern whosetransformations accurately fit various input images. We examine two objectivesof the manifold building problem, namely, approximation and classification. Forthe approximation problem, we propose a greedy method that constructs arepresentative pattern by selecting analytic atoms from a continuous dictionarymanifold. We present a DC (Difference-of-Convex) optimization scheme that isapplicable to a wide range of transformation and dictionary models, anddemonstrate its application to transformation manifolds generated by rotation,translation and anisotropic scaling of a reference pattern. Then, we generalizethis approach to a setting with multiple transformation manifolds, where eachmanifold represents a different class of signals. We present an iterativemultiple manifold building algorithm such that the classification accuracy ispromoted in the learning of the representative patterns. Experimental resultssuggest that the proposed methods yield high accuracy in the approximation andclassification of data compared to some reference methods, while the invarianceto geometric transformations is achieved due to the transformation manifoldmodel.

Zomaya, Reza Moraveji category:cs.DC cs.AI cs.LG cs.PF published:2011-12-23 summary:In this paper, we study CPU utilization time patterns of several Map-Reduceapplications. After extracting running patterns of several applications, thepatterns with their statistical information are saved in a reference databaseto be later used to tweak system parameters to efficiently execute unknownapplications in future. To achieve this goal, CPU utilization patterns of newapplications along with its statistical information are compared with thealready known ones in the reference database to find/predict their mostprobable execution patterns. Because of different patterns lengths, the DynamicTime Warping (DTW) is utilized for such comparison; a statistical analysis isthen applied to DTWs' outcomes to select the most suitable candidates.Moreover, under a hypothesis, another algorithm is proposed to classifyapplications under similar CPU utilization patterns. Three widely used textprocessing applications (WordCount, Distributed Grep, and Terasort) and anotherapplication (Exim Mainlog parsing) are used to evaluate our hypothesis intweaking system parameters in executing similar applications. Results were verypromising and showed effectiveness of our approach on 5-node Map-Reduceplatform

The performance of parallelimaging strongly depends on the reconstruction algorithm, which can proceedeither in the original k-space (GRAPPA, SMASH) or in the image domain(SENSE-like methods). To improve the performance of the widely used SENSEalgorithm, 2D- or slice-specific regularization in the wavelet domain has beendeeply investigated. In this paper, we extend this approach using 3D-waveletrepresentations in order to handle all slices together and addressreconstruction artifacts which propagate across adjacent slices. The gaininduced by such extension (3D-Unconstrained Wavelet Regularized -SENSE:3D-UWR-SENSE) is validated on anatomical image reconstruction where no temporalacquisition is considered. Another important extension accounts for temporalcorrelations that exist between successive scans in functional MRI (fMRI). Inaddition to the case of 2D+t acquisition schemes addressed by some othermethods like kt-FOCUSS, our approach allows us to deal with 3D+t acquisitionschemes which are widely used in neuroimaging. The resulting 3D-UWR-SENSE and4D-UWR-SENSE reconstruction schemes are fully unsupervised in the sense thatall regularization parameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood sense ona reference scan. The gain induced by such extensions is illustrated on bothanatomical and functional image reconstruction, and also measured in terms ofstatistical sensitivity for the 4D-UWR-SENSE approach during a fastevent-related fMRI protocol. Our 4D-UWR-SENSE algorithm outperforms the SENSEreconstruction at the subject and group levels (15 subjects) for differentcontrasts of interest (eg, motor or computation tasks) and using differentparallel acceleration factors (R=2 and R=4) on 2x2x3mm3 EPI images.

I focus on automatically inventing or discovering problems in a wayinspired by the playful behavior of animals and humans, to train a more andmore general problem solver from scratch in an unsupervised fashion. Considerthe infinite set of all computable descriptions of tasks with possiblycomputable solutions. The novel algorithmic framework POWERPLAY (2011)continually searches the space of possible pairs of new tasks and modificationsof the current problem solver, until it finds a more powerful problem solverthat provably solves all previously learned tasks plus the new one, while theunmodified predecessor does not. Wow-effects are achieved by continually makingpreviously learned skills more efficient such that they require less time andspace. New skills may (partially) re-use previously learned skills. POWERPLAY'ssearch orders candidate pairs of tasks and solver modifications by theirconditional computational (time & space) complexity, given the storedexperience so far. The new task and its corresponding task-solving skill arethose first found and validated. The computational costs of validating newtasks need not grow with task repertoire size. POWERPLAY's ongoing search fornovelty keeps breaking the generalization abilities of its present solver. Thisis related to Goedel's sequence of increasingly powerful formal theories basedon adding formerly unprovable statements to the axioms without affectingpreviously provable theorems. The continually increasing repertoire of problemsolving procedures can be exploited by a parallel search for solutions toadditional externally posed tasks. POWERPLAY may be viewed as a greedy butpractical implementation of basic principles of creativity. A firstexperimental analysis can be found in separate papers [53,54].

In this work we examine thenotion of combining one-class classifiers as an alternative for selecting thebest classifier. In particular, we propose two new one-class classificationperformance measures to weigh classifiers and show that a simple ensemble thatimplements these measures can outperform the most popular one-class ensembles.Furthermore, we propose a new one-class ensemble scheme, TUPSO, which usesmeta-learning to combine one-class classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate thesuperiority of TUPSO over all other tested ensembles and show that the TUPSOperformance is statistically indistinguishable from that of the hypotheticalbest classifier.
