arxiv-1206-4651 | Is margin preserved after random projection? |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4651  | author:Qinfeng Shi, Chunhua Shen, Rhys Hill, Anton van den Hengel category:cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML published:2012-06-18 summary:Random projections have been applied in many machine learning algorithms.However, whether margin is preserved after random projection is non-trivial andnot well studied. In this paper we analyse margin distortion after randomprojection, and give the conditions of margin preservation for binaryclassification problems. We also extend our analysis to margin for multiclassproblems, and provide theoretical bounds on multiclass margin on the projecteddata.

Focusing on a particular covariateshift problem, we derive high probability confidence bounds for the kernel meanmatching (KMM) estimator, whose convergence rate turns out to depend on someregularity measure of the regression function and also on some capacity measureof the kernel. By comparing KMM with the natural plug-in estimator, weestablish the superiority of the former hence provide concreteevidence/understanding to the effectiveness of KMM under covariate shift.
arxiv-1206-4649 | Learning Efficient Structured Sparse Models |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4649  | author:Alex Bronstein, Pablo Sprechmann, Guillermo Sapiro category:cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML published:2012-06-18 summary:We present a comprehensive framework for structured sparse coding andmodeling extending the recent ideas of using learnable fast regressors toapproximate exact sparse codes. For this purpose, we develop a novelblock-coordinate proximal splitting method for the iterative solution ofhierarchical sparse coding problems, and show an efficient feed forwardarchitecture derived from its iteration. This architecture faithfullyapproximates the exact structured sparse codes with a fraction of thecomplexity of the standard optimization methods. We also show that by usingdifferent training objective functions, learnable sparse encoders are no longerrestricted to be mere approximants of the exact sparse code for a pre-givendictionary, as in earlier formulations, but can be rather used as full-featuredsparse encoders or even modelers. A simple implementation shows several ordersof magnitude speedup compared to the state-of-the-art at minimal performancedegradation, making the proposed framework suitable for real time andlarge-scale applications.

These methods have had somesuccesses, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust tonoise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in whichwe simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing adifferent view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learningproblems together, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where anon-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise inthe other, reducing bias. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifoldproblems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators inHilbert space, and discuss when two-manifold problems are useful. Finally, wedemonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlineardynamical system from limited data.

We propose a generic formulation ofembedding algorithms that includes SNE and other existing algorithms, and studytheir relation with spectral methods and graph Laplacians. This allows us todefine several partial-Hessian optimization strategies, characterize theirglobal and local convergence, and evaluate them empirically. We achieve up totwo orders of magnitude speedup over existing training methods with a strategy(which we call the spectral direction) that adds nearly no overhead to thegradient and yet is simple, scalable and applicable to several existing andfuture embedding algorithms.

New piecewise linear convex regressionmethods are fast and scalable, but can have instability when used toapproximate constraints or objective functions for optimization. Ensemblemethods, like bagging, smearing and random partitioning, can alleviate thisproblem and maintain the theoretical properties of the underlying estimator. Weempirically examine the performance of ensemble methods for prediction andoptimization, and then apply them to device modeling and constraintapproximation for geometric programming based circuit design.
arxiv-1206-4644 | Groupwise Constrained Reconstruction for Subspace Clustering |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4644  | author:Ruijiang Li, Bin Li, Ke Zhang, Cheng Jin, Xiangyang Xue category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-18 summary:Reconstruction based subspace clustering methods compute a selfreconstruction matrix over the samples and use it for spectral clustering toobtain the final clustering result. Their success largely relies on theassumption that the underlying subspaces are independent, which, however, doesnot always hold in the applications with increasing number of subspaces. Inthis paper, we propose a novel reconstruction based subspace clustering modelwithout making the subspace independence assumption. In our model, certainproperties of the reconstruction matrix are explicitly characterized using thelatent cluster indicators, and the affinity matrix used for spectral clusteringcan be directly built from the posterior of the latent cluster indicatorsinstead of the reconstruction matrix. Experimental results on both syntheticand real-world datasets show that the proposed model can outperform thestate-of-the-art methods.

Previousstudies all restrict to the case that uncertainties among different states areuncoupled, which leads to conservative solutions. In contrast, we introduce anintuitive concept, termed "Lightning Does not Strike Twice," to model coupleduncertain parameters. Specifically, we require that the system can deviate fromits nominal parameters only a bounded number of times. We give probabilisticguarantees indicating that this model represents real life situations anddevise tractable algorithms for computing optimal control policies using thisconcept.

Kimura et al. (2011) proposed a kernel function forunordered trees on the basis of their subpaths, which are verticalsubstructures of trees responsible for hierarchical information in them. Theirkernel exhibits practically good performance in terms of accuracy and speed;however, linear-time computation is not guaranteed theoretically, unlike thecase of the other unordered tree kernel proposed by Vishwanathan and Smola(2003). In this paper, we propose a theoretically guaranteed linear-time kernelcomputation algorithm that is practically fast, and we present an efficientprediction algorithm whose running time depends only on the size of the inputtree. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are quiteefficient in practice.

This paper investigates how to extend TV and EE to the supervisedlearning settings on high dimensional data. The supervised learning problem canbe formulated as an energy functional minimization under Tikhonovregularization scheme, where the energy is composed of a squared loss and atotal variation smoothing (or Euler's elastica smoothing). Its solution viavariational principles leads to an Euler-Lagrange PDE. However, the PDE isalways high-dimensional and cannot be directly solved by common methods.Instead, radial basis functions are utilized to approximate the targetfunction, reducing the problem to finding the linear coefficients of basisfunctions. We apply the proposed methods to supervised learning tasks(including binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression)on benchmark data sets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated promisingresults of the proposed methods.

Extending these algorithms tomatrix models pose challenges since the number of free parameters in thecovariance of the distribution scales as $n^4$ with the dimension $n$ of thematrix, and $n$ tends to be large in real applications. We describe, analyzeand experiment with two new algorithms for learning distribution of matrixmodels. Our first algorithm maintains a diagonal covariance over the parametersand can handle large covariance matrices. The second algorithm factors thecovariance to capture inter-features correlation while keeping the number ofparameters linear in the size of the original matrix. We analyze bothalgorithms in the mistake bound model and show a superior precision performanceof our approach over other algorithms in two tasks: retrieving similar images,and ranking similar documents. The factored algorithm is shown to attain fasterconvergence rate.

Projection-basedmethods have been widely applied to learning tasks constrained by such norms.As a key building block of these methods, an efficient operator for Euclideanprojection onto the intersection of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_{1,q}$ norm balls$(q=2\text{or}\infty)$ is proposed in this paper. We prove that the projectioncan be reduced to finding the root of an auxiliary function which is piecewisesmooth and monotonic. Hence, a bisection algorithm is sufficient to solve theproblem. We show that the time complexity of our solution is $O(n+g\log g)$ for$q=2$ and $O(n\log n)$ for $q=\infty$, where $n$ is the dimensionality of thevector to be projected and $g$ is the number of disjoint groups; we confirmthis complexity by experimentation. Empirical study reveals that our methodachieves significantly better performance than classical methods in terms ofrunning time and memory usage. We further show that embedded with our efficientprojection operator, projection-based algorithms can solve regression problemswith composite norm constraints more efficiently than other methods and givesuperior accuracy.

arxiv-1206-4636 | Modeling Latent Variable Uncertainty for Loss-based Learning |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4636  | author:M. Pawan Kumar, Ben Packer, Daphne Koller category:cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV published:2012-06-18 summary:We consider the problem of parameter estimation using weakly superviseddatasets, where a training sample consists of the input and a partiallyspecified annotation, which we refer to as the output. The missing informationin the annotation is modeled using latent variables. Previous methodsoverburden a single distribution with two separate tasks: (i) modeling theuncertainty in the latent variables during training; and (ii) making accuratepredictions for the output and the latent variables during testing. We proposea novel framework that separates the demands of the two tasks using twodistributions: (i) a conditional distribution to model the uncertainty of thelatent variables for a given input-output pair; and (ii) a delta distributionto predict the output and the latent variables for a given input. Duringlearning, we encourage agreement between the two distributions by minimizing aloss-based dissimilarity coefficient. Our approach generalizes latent SVM intwo important ways: (i) it models the uncertainty over latent variables insteadof relying on a pointwise estimate; and (ii) it allows the use of lossfunctions that depend on latent variables, which greatly increases itsapplicability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two challengingproblems---object detection and action detection---using publicly availabledatasets.

After learning each layer, samples from the posteriordistributions for that layer are used as training data for learning the nextlayer. This approach is commonly used with Restricted Boltzmann Machines, whichare undirected graphical models with a single hidden layer, but it can also beused with Mixtures of Factor Analysers (MFAs) which are directed graphicalmodels. In this paper, we present a greedy layer-wise learning algorithm forDeep Mixtures of Factor Analysers (DMFAs). Even though a DMFA can be convertedto an equivalent shallow MFA by multiplying together the factor loadingmatrices at different levels, learning and inference are much more efficient ina DMFA and the sharing of each lower-level factor loading matrix by manydifferent higher level MFAs prevents overfitting. We demonstrate empiricallythat DMFAs learn better density models than both MFAs and two types ofRestricted Boltzmann Machine on a wide variety of datasets.

We also provide elaborate design of actions, states, and rewardstailored for a Sumi-e agent. The effectiveness of our proposed approach isdemonstrated through simulated Sumi-e experiments.

H. Hoi category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-18 summary:Kernel-based online learning has often shown state-of-the-art performance formany online learning tasks. It, however, suffers from a major shortcoming, thatis, the unbounded number of support vectors, making it non-scalable andunsuitable for applications with large-scale datasets. In this work, we studythe problem of bounded kernel-based online learning that aims to constrain thenumber of support vectors by a predefined budget. Although several algorithmshave been proposed in literature, they are neither computationally efficientdue to their intensive budget maintenance strategy nor effective due to the useof simple Perceptron algorithm. To overcome these limitations, we propose aframework for bounded kernel-based online learning based on an online gradientdescent approach. We propose two efficient algorithms of bounded onlinegradient descent (BOGD) for scalable kernel-based online learning: (i) BOGD bymaintaining support vectors using uniform sampling, and (ii) BOGD++ bymaintaining support vectors using non-uniform sampling. We present theoreticalanalysis of regret bound for both algorithms, and found promising empiricalperformance in terms of both efficacy and efficiency by comparing them toseveral well-known algorithms for bounded kernel-based online learning onlarge-scale datasets.

While the l_{1,2} and the l_{1,\infty} version have beenstudied in detail and efficient algorithms exist, there are still openquestions regarding other l_{1,p} variants. We characterize conditions forsolutions of the l_{1,p} Group-Lasso for all p-norms with 1 <= p <= \infty, andwe present a unified active set algorithm. For all p-norms, a highly efficientprojected gradient algorithm is presented. This new algorithm enables us tocompare the prediction performance of many variants of the Group-Lasso in amulti-task learning setting, where the aim is to solve many learning problemsin parallel which are coupled via the Group-Lasso constraint. We conductlarge-scale experiments on synthetic data and on two real-world data sets. Inaccordance with theoretical characterizations of the different norms we observethat the weak-coupling norms with p between 1.5 and 2 consistently outperformthe strong-coupling norms with p >> 2.

The maximum likelihood solution for the model is an eigenvalue problemon the sample covariance matrix. In this paper we consider the situation wherethe data variance is already partially explained by other actors, for examplesparse conditional dependencies between the covariates, or temporalcorrelations leaving some residual variance. We decompose the residual varianceinto its components through a generalised eigenvalue problem, which we callresidual component analysis (RCA). We explore a range of new algorithms thatarise from the framework, including one that factorises the covariance of aGaussian density into a low-rank and a sparse-inverse component. We illustratethe ideas on the recovery of a protein-signaling network, a gene expressiontime-series data set and the recovery of the human skeleton from motion capture3-D cloud data.

Unfortunately, in structured prediction settings with expressiveinter-variable interactions, exact inference-based learning algorithms, e.g.Structural SVM, are often intractable. We present a new way, DecomposedLearning (DecL), which performs efficient learning by restricting the inferencestep to a limited part of the structured spaces. We provide characterizationsbased on the structure, target parameters, and gold labels, under which DecL isequivalent to exact learning. We then show that in real world settings, whereour theoretical assumptions may not completely hold, DecL-based algorithms aresignificantly more efficient and as accurate as exact learning.

This isin contrast to most of the previous studies on multiple kernel learning thatmainly focus on developing efficient algorithms and assume perfectly labeledtraining examples. Directly applying the existing multiple kernel learningalgorithms to noisily labeled examples often leads to suboptimal performancedue to the incorrect class assignments. We address this challenge by castingmultiple kernel learning from noisy labels into a stochastic programmingproblem, and presenting a minimax formulation. We develop an efficientalgorithm for solving the related convex-concave optimization problem with afast convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ where $T$ is the number of iterations.Empirical studies on UCI data sets verify both the effectiveness of theproposed framework and the efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithm.

Wemotivate this problem in the context of learning the structure and parametersof Ising models. We first provide a convergence-rate analysis of deterministicerrors for forward-backward splitting (FBS). We then extend our analysis tobiased stochastic errors, by first characterizing a family of samplers andproviding a high probability bound that allows understanding not only FBS, butalso proximal gradient (PG) methods. We derive some interesting conclusions:FBS requires only a logarithmically increasing number of random samples inorder to converge (although at a very low rate); the required number of randomsamples is the same for the deterministic and the biased stochastic setting forFBS and basic PG; accelerated PG is not guaranteed to converge in the biasedstochastic setting.

Hoi category:cs.CE cs.LG q-fin.PM published:2012-06-18 summary:On-line portfolio selection has attracted increasing interests in machinelearning and AI communities recently. Empirical evidences show that stock'shigh and low prices are temporary and stock price relatives are likely tofollow the mean reversion phenomenon. While the existing mean reversionstrategies are shown to achieve good empirical performance on many realdatasets, they often make the single-period mean reversion assumption, which isnot always satisfied in some real datasets, leading to poor performance whenthe assumption does not hold. To overcome the limitation, this article proposesa multiple-period mean reversion, or so-called Moving Average Reversion (MAR),and a new on-line portfolio selection strategy named "On-Line Moving AverageReversion" (OLMAR), which exploits MAR by applying powerful online learningtechniques. From our empirical results, we found that OLMAR can overcome thedrawback of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly betterresults, especially on the datasets where the existing mean reversionalgorithms failed. In addition to superior trading performance, OLMAR also runsextremely fast, further supporting its practical applicability to a wide rangeof applications.

Algorithms for learning to maximize F-measures follow twoapproaches: the empirical utility maximization (EUM) approach learns aclassifier having optimal performance on training data, while thedecision-theoretic approach learns a probabilistic model and then predictslabels with maximum expected F-measure. In this paper, we investigate thetheoretical justifications and connections for these two approaches, and westudy the conditions under which one approach is preferable to the other usingsynthetic and real datasets. Given accurate models, our results suggest thatthe two approaches are asymptotically equivalent given large training and testsets. Nevertheless, empirically, the EUM approach appears to be more robustagainst model misspecification, and given a good model, the decision-theoreticapproach appears to be better for handling rare classes and a common domainadaptation scenario.

In the local learning stage, RMMSL efficiently estimateslocal tangent space by weighted low-rank matrix factorization. In the globallearning stage, we propose a robust manifold clustering method based on localstructure learning results. The proposed clustering method is designed to getthe flattest manifolds clusters by introducing a novel curved-level similarityfunction. Our approach is evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art methods onsynthetic data, handwritten digit images, human motion capture data andmotorbike videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,which yields higher clustering accuracy, and produces promising results forchallenging tasks of human motion segmentation and motion flow learning fromvideos.

Using this formula, we are able to connect the cardinality of thedictionary with the eigen-decay of the covariance operator. In particular, weshow that under certain technical conditions, the size of the dictionary willalways grow sub-linearly in the number of data points, and, as a consequence,the kernel linear regressor constructed from the resulting dictionary isconsistent.

The prediction of a user's rating on an item is then given by that ratingof neighbouring items, weighted by their similarity. This paper presents a newneighbourhood approach which we call item fields, whereby an undirectedgraphical model is formed over the item graph. The resulting prediction rule isa simple generalization of the classical approaches, which takes into accountnon-local information in the graph, allowing its best results to be obtainedwhen using drastically fewer edges than other neighbourhood approaches. A fastapproximate maximum entropy training method based on the Bethe approximation ispresented, which uses a simple gradient ascent procedure. When usingprecomputed sufficient statistics on the Movielens datasets, our method isfaster than maximum likelihood approaches by two orders of magnitude.

PI2is a recent example of this approach. It combines a derivation from firstprinciples of stochastic optimal control with tools from statistical estimationtheory. In this paper, we consider PI2 as a member of the wider family ofmethods which share the concept of probability-weighted averaging toiteratively update parameters to optimize a cost function. We compare PI2 toother members of the same family - Cross-Entropy Methods and CMAES - at theconceptual level and in terms of performance. The comparison suggests thederivation of a novel algorithm which we call PI2-CMA for "Path Integral PolicyImprovement with Covariance Matrix Adaptation". PI2-CMA's main advantage isthat it determines the magnitude of the exploration noise automatically.

During induction of decision trees one aims to find predicates thatare maximally informative about the prediction target. To select goodpredicates most approaches estimate an information-theoretic scoring function,the information gain, both for classification and regression problems. We pointout that the common estimation procedures are biased and show that by replacingthem with improved estimators of the discrete and the differential entropy wecan obtain better decision trees. In effect our modifications yield improvedpredictive performance and are simple to implement in any decision tree code.

However, some limitations couldprevent them from working effectively in certain domains. For example, manyexisting approaches are intrinsically unsupervised, which does not incorporateside information (e.g., class labels) to produce task specific decompositions;also, they typically work "transductively", i.e., the factorization does notgeneralize to new samples, so the complete factorization needs to be recomputedwhen new samples become available. To solve these problems, in this paper wepropose an"inductive"-flavored method for low-rank kernel decomposition withpriors. We achieve this by generalizing the Nystr\"om method in a novel way. Onthe one hand, our approach employs a highly flexible, nonparametric structurethat allows us to generalize the low-rank factors to arbitrarily new samples;on the other hand, it has linear time and space complexities, which can beorders of magnitudes faster than existing approaches and renders greatefficiency in learning a low-rank kernel decomposition. Empirical resultsdemonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.

To this end, this paper proposes a novel hyperplane hashingtechnique which yields compact hash codes. The key idea is the bilinear form ofthe proposed hash functions, which leads to higher collision probability thanthe existing hyperplane hash functions when using random projections. Tofurther increase the performance, we propose a learning based framework inwhich the bilinear functions are directly learned from the data. This resultsin short yet discriminative codes, and also boosts the search performance overthe random projection based solutions. Large-scale active learning experimentscarried out on two datasets with up to one million samples demonstrate theoverall superiority of the proposed approach.

We introduce a probabilisticinverse optimal control algorithm that scales gracefully with taskdimensionality, and is suitable for large, continuous domains where evencomputing a full policy is impractical. By using a local approximation of thereward function, our method can also drop the assumption that thedemonstrations are globally optimal, requiring only local optimality. Thisallows it to learn from examples that are unsuitable for prior methods.

Our seizure dataset contains brain activityrecorded in typically more than a hundred individual channels for each seizureof each patient. The MLC-HDP model clusters over channels-types, seizure-types,and patient-types simultaneously. We describe this model and its implementationin detail. We also present the results of a simulation study comparing theMLC-HDP to a similar model, the Nested Dirichlet Process and finallydemonstrate the MLC-HDP's use in modeling seizures across multiple patients. Wefind the MLC-HDP's clustering to be comparable to independent human physicianclusterings. To our knowledge, the MLC-HDP model is the first in the epilepsyliterature capable of clustering seizures within and between patients.

The groundbreaking innovations and novel methods help in the early detection, in settingthe stages of the therapy and in assessing the response of the patient to thetreatment. The prediction of the recurrent cancer is also crucial for thesurvival of the patient. This paper studies various techniques used for thediagnosis of breast cancer. Different methods are explored for their merits andde-merits for the diagnosis of breast lesion. Some of the methods are yetunproven but the studies look very encouraging. It was found that the recentuse of the combination of Artificial Neural Networks in most of the instancesgives accurate results for the diagnosis of breast cancer and their use canalso be extended to other diseases.

If the curveevolution fails to converge, we would not be able to solve the targeted problemin a lifetime. This paper studies the theoretical aspect of the convergence ofa type of general curve evolutions. We establish a theory for analyzing andimproving the stability of the convergence of the general curve evolutions.Based on this theory, we ascertain that the convergence of a known curveevolution is marginal stable. We propose a way of modifying the original curveevolution equation to improve the stability of the convergence according to ourtheory. Numerical experiments show that the modification improves theconvergence of the curve evolution, which validates our theory.

Our proposed modelremoves these constraints, acquiring important aspects from the informationgeometry. The proposed parameter- and structure-learning algorithms are simpleto execute as they are based solely on local computation at each node.Experiments demonstrate that our algorithms work appropriately.

LIGs facilitate causal strategicinference (CSI): Making inferences from causal interventions on stable behaviorin strategic settings. Applications include the identification of the mostinfluential individuals in large (social) networks. Such tasks can also supportpolicy-making analysis. Motivated by the computational work on LIGs, we castthe learning problem as maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of a generativemodel defined by pure-strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE). Our simple formulationuncovers the fundamental interplay between goodness-of-fit and modelcomplexity: good models capture equilibrium behavior within the data whilecontrolling the true number of equilibria, including those unobserved. Weprovide a generalization bound establishing the sample complexity for MLE inour framework. We propose several algorithms including convex loss minimization(CLM) and sigmoidal approximations. We prove that the number of exact PSNE inLIGs is small, with high probability; thus, CLM is sound. We illustrate ourapproach on synthetic data and real-world U.S. congressional voting records. Webriefly discuss our learning framework's generality and potential applicabilityto general graphical games.

Although there exist numerous methods, feature based imageextraction becomes a popular one in the field of image processing. Theobjective of image segmentation is the domain-independent partition of theimage into a set of regions, which are visually distinct and uniform withrespect to some property, such as grey level, texture or colour. Segmentationand subsequent extraction can be considered the first step and key issue inobject recognition, scene understanding and image analysis. Its applicationarea encompasses mobile devices, industrial quality control, medicalappliances, robot navigation, geophysical exploration, military applications,etc. In all these areas, the quality of the final results depends largely onthe quality of the preprocessing work. Most of the times, acquiringspurious-free preprocessing data requires a lot of application cum mathematicalintensive background works. We propose a feature based fuzzy rule guided noveltechnique that is functionally devoid of any external intervention duringexecution. Experimental results suggest that this approach is an efficient onein comparison to different other techniques extensively addressed inliterature. In order to justify the supremacy of performance of our proposedtechnique in respect of its competitors, we take recourse to effective metricslike Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Peak Signal toNoise Ratio (PSNR).
arxiv-1206-3666 | Unsupervised adaptation of brain machine interface decoders |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3666  | author:Tayfun Gürel, Carsten Mehring category:cs.LG q-bio.NC published:2012-06-16 summary:The performance of neural decoders can degrade over time due tononstationarities in the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior.In this case, brain-machine interfaces (BMI) require adaptation of theirdecoders to maintain high performance across time. One way to achieve this isby use of periodical calibration phases, during which the BMI system (or anexternal human demonstrator) instructs the user to perform certain movements orbehaviors. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) calibration phasesinterrupt the autonomous operation of the BMI and (ii) between two calibrationphases the BMI performance might not be stable but continuously decrease. Abetter alternative would be that the BMI decoder is able to continuously adaptin an unsupervised manner during autonomous BMI operation, i.e. without knowingthe movement intentions of the user. In the present article, we present an efficient method for such unsupervisedtraining of BMI systems for continuous movement control. The proposed methodutilizes a cost function derived from neuronal recordings, which guides alearning algorithm to evaluate the decoding parameters. We verify theperformance of our adaptive method by simulating a BMI user with an optimalfeedback control model and its interaction with our adaptive BMI decoder. Thesimulation results show that the cost function and the algorithm yield fast andprecise trajectories towards targets at random orientations on a 2-dimensionalcomputer screen. For initially unknown and non-stationary tuning parameters,our unsupervised method is still able to generate precise trajectories and tokeep its performance stable in the long term. The algorithm can optionally workalso with neuronal error signals instead or in conjunction with the proposedunsupervised adaptation.

Efros, Martial Hebert category:cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG published:2012-06-16 summary:The main stated contribution of the Deformable Parts Model (DPM) detector ofFelzenszwalb et al. (over the Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients approach of Dalaland Triggs) is the use of deformable parts. A secondary contribution is thelatent discriminative learning. Tertiary is the use of multiple components. Acommon belief in the vision community (including ours, before this study) isthat their ordering of contributions reflects the performance of detector inpractice. However, what we have experimentally found is that the ordering ofimportance might actually be the reverse. First, we show that by increasing thenumber of components, and switching the initialization step from theiraspect-ratio, left-right flipping heuristics to appearance-based clustering,considerable improvement in performance is obtained. But more intriguingly, weshow that with these new components, the part deformations can now becompletely switched off, yet obtaining results that are almost on par with theoriginal DPM detector. Finally, we also show initial results for using multiplecomponents on a different problem -- scene classification, suggesting that thisidea might have wider applications in addition to object detection.

Themethod of inverse PSF evaluation with regularization functional as the functionof surface area is offered. The inverse PSF was used for primary imageestimation. Two methods of original image estimate optimization were designedbasing on maximum entropy generalization of sought and blurred imagesconditional probability density and regularization. The first method usesbalanced variations of convolution and deconvolution transforms to obtainingiterative schema of image optimization. The variations balance was defined bydynamic regularization basing on condition of iteration process convergence.The regularization has dynamic character because depends on current andprevious image estimate variations. The second method implements theregularization of deconvolution optimization in curved space with metricdefined on image estimate surface. It is basing on target functional invarianceto fluctuations of optimal argument value. The given iterative schemas havefaster convergence in comparison with known ones, so they can be used forreconstruction of high resolution images series in real time.

Based on thefitness-level method, it yields upper bounds on the expected parallel runningtime. This allows to rigorously estimate the speedup gained by parallelization.Tailored results are given for common migration topologies: ring graphs, torusgraphs, hypercubes, and the complete graph. Example applications forpseudo-Boolean optimization show that our method is easy to apply and that itgives powerful results. In our examples the possible speedup increases with thedensity of the topology. Surprisingly, even sparse topologies like ring graphslead to a significant speedup for many functions while not increasing the totalnumber of function evaluations by more than a constant factor. We also identifywhich number of processors yield asymptotically optimal speedups, thus givinghints on how to parametrize parallel evolutionary algorithms.

Inthis context we have assumed two hidden markov models. In first model we havetaken protein secondary structures as hidden and protein sequences as observed.In second model we have taken protein sequences as hidden and proteinstructures as observed. The efficiencies for both the hidden markov models havebeen calculated. The results show that the efficiencies of first model isgreater that the second one .These efficiencies are cross validated usingartificial neural network. This signifies the importance of protein secondarystructures as the main hidden controlling factors due to which we observe aparticular amino acid sequence. This also signifies that protein secondarystructure is more conserved in comparison to amino acid sequence.
arxiv-1206-3382 | Simple Regret Optimization in Online Planning for Markov Decision Processes |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3382  | author:Zohar Feldman, Carmel Domshlak category:cs.AI cs.LG published:2012-06-15 summary:We consider online planning in Markov decision processes (MDPs). In onlineplanning, the agent focuses on its current state only, deliberates about theset of possible policies from that state onwards and, when interrupted, usesthe outcome of that exploratory deliberation to choose what action to performnext. The performance of algorithms for online planning is assessed in terms ofsimple regret, which is the agent's expected performance loss when the chosenaction, rather than an optimal one, is followed. To date, state-of-the-art algorithms for online planning in general MDPs areeither best effort, or guarantee only polynomial-rate reduction of simpleregret over time. Here we introduce a new Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm,BRUE, that guarantees exponential-rate reduction of simple regret and errorprobability. This algorithm is based on a simple yet non-standard state-spacesampling scheme, MCTS2e, in which different parts of each sample are dedicatedto different exploratory objectives. Our empirical evaluation shows that BRUEnot only provides superior performance guarantees, but is also very effectivein practice and favorably compares to state-of-the-art. We then extend BRUEwith a variant of "learning by forgetting." The resulting set of algorithms,BRUE(alpha), generalizes BRUE, improves the exponential factor in the upperbound on its reduction rate, and exhibits even more attractive empiricalperformance.

Alice candraw a sample of any size before issuing her prediction. How much better canshe do than Bob? Perhaps surprisingly, under a large class of loss functions,which we refer to as the Cover-Hart family, the best Alice can do is to halveBob's risk. In this sense, half the information in an infinite sample iscontained in a sample of size one. The Cover-Hart family is a convex cone thatincludes metrics and negative definite functions, subject to slight regularityconditions. These results may help explain the small relative differences inempirical performance measures in applied classification and forecastingproblems, as well as the success of reasoning and learning by analogy ingeneral, and nearest neighbor techniques in particular.

It is motivated by the growing occurrence, in medical imaging andcomputational anatomy, of what can be described as geometrico-functional data,that is a data structure that involves a deformable shape (roughly a finitedimensional sub manifold) together with a function defined on this shape takingvalue in another manifold. Indeed, if mathematical currents have already proved to be very efficienttheoretically and numerically to model and process shapes as curves orsurfaces, they are limited to the manipulation of purely geometrical objects.We show that the introduction of the concept of functional currents offers agenuine solution to the simultaneous processing of the geometric and signalinformation of any functional shape. We explain how functional currents can beequipped with a Hilbertian norm mixing geometrical and functional content offunctional shapes nicely behaving under geometrical and functionalperturbations and paving the way to various processing algorithms. Weillustrate this potential on two problems: the redundancy reduction offunctional shapes representations through matching pursuit schemes onfunctional currents and the simultaneous geometric and functional registrationof functional shapes under diffeomorphic transport.

Each player can pick among multiple arms.When a player picks an arm, it gets a reward. We consider both i.i.d. rewardmodel and Markovian reward model. In the i.i.d. model each arm is modelled asan i.i.d. process with an unknown distribution with an unknown mean. In theMarkovian model, each arm is modelled as a finite, irreducible, aperiodic andreversible Markov chain with an unknown probability transition matrix andstationary distribution. The arms give different rewards to different players.If two players pick the same arm, there is a "collision", and neither of themget any reward. There is no dedicated control channel for coordination orcommunication among the players. Any other communication between the users iscostly and will add to the regret. We propose an online index-based distributedlearning policy called ${\tt dUCB_4}$ algorithm that trades off\textit{exploration v. exploitation} in the right way, and achieves expectedregret that grows at most as near-$O(\log^2 T)$. The motivation comes fromopportunistic spectrum access by multiple secondary users in cognitive radionetworks wherein they must pick among various wireless channels that lookdifferent to different users. This is the first distributed learning algorithmfor multi-player MABs to the best of our knowledge.

Kakade, Percy Liang category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2012-06-14 summary:This paper explores unsupervised learning of parsing models along twodirections. First, which models are identifiable from infinite data? We use ageneral technique for numerically checking identifiability based on the rank ofa Jacobian matrix, and apply it to several standard constituency and dependencyparsing models. Second, for identifiable models, how do we estimate theparameters efficiently? EM suffers from local optima, while recent work usingspectral methods cannot be directly applied since the topology of the parsetree varies across sentences. We develop a strategy, unmixing, which deals withthis additional complexity for restricted classes of parsing models.

Sayed category:cs.LG cs.DC published:2012-06-14 summary:This article proposes diffusion LMS strategies for distributed estimationover adaptive networks that are able to exploit sparsity in the underlyingsystem model. The approach relies on convex regularization, common incompressive sensing, to enhance the detection of sparsity via a diffusiveprocess over the network. The resulting algorithms endow networks with learningabilities and allow them to learn the sparse structure from the incoming datain real-time, and also to track variations in the sparsity of the model. Weprovide convergence and mean-square performance analysis of the proposed methodand show under what conditions it outperforms the unregularized diffusionversion. We also show how to adaptively select the regularization parameter.Simulation results illustrate the advantage of the proposed filters for sparsedata recovery.
arxiv-1206-3204 | Improved Spectral-Norm Bounds for Clustering |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3204  | author:Pranjal Awasthi, Or Sheffet category:cs.LG cs.DS published:2012-06-14 summary:Aiming to unify known results about clustering mixtures of distributionsunder separation conditions, Kumar and Kannan[2010] introduced a deterministiccondition for clustering datasets. They showed that this single deterministiccondition encompasses many previously studied clustering assumptions. Morespecifically, their proximity condition requires that in the target$k$-clustering, the projection of a point $x$ onto the line joining its clustercenter $\mu$ and some other center $\mu'$, is a large additive factor closer to$\mu$ than to $\mu'$. This additive factor can be roughly described as $k$times the spectral norm of the matrix representing the differences between thegiven (known) dataset and the means of the (unknown) target clustering.Clearly, the proximity condition implies center separation -- the distancebetween any two centers must be as large as the above mentioned bound. In this paper we improve upon the work of Kumar and Kannan along severalaxes. First, we weaken the center separation bound by a factor of $\sqrt{k}$,and secondly we weaken the proximity condition by a factor of $k$. Using theseweaker bounds we still achieve the same guarantees when all points satisfy theproximity condition. We also achieve better guarantees when only$(1-\epsilon)$-fraction of the points satisfy the weaker proximity condition.The bulk of our analysis relies only on center separation under which one canproduce a clustering which (i) has low error, (ii) has low $k$-means cost, and(iii) has centers very close to the target centers. Our improved separation condition allows us to match the results of thePlanted Partition Model of McSherry[2001], improve upon the results ofOstrovsky et al[2006], and improve separation results for mixture of Gaussianmodels in a particular setting.

We describe a reinforcementlearning algorithm for learning in thesedomains and prove for certain environments the algorithm is probablyapproximately correct with a sample complexity that scales polynomially withthe state-space dimension. Unfortunately, no optimal planning techniques existin general for such problems; instead we use fitted value iteration to solvethe learned MDP, and include the error due to approximate planning in ourbounds. Finally, we report an experiment using a robotic car driving overvarying terrain to demonstrate that these dynamics representations adequatelycapture real-world dynamics and that our algorithm can be used to efficientlysolve such problems.

Spirtes, Joseph Ramsey, Gustavo Lacerda, Shohei Shimizu category:stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG published:2012-06-13 summary:An important task in data analysis is the discovery of causal relationshipsbetween observed variables. For continuous-valued data, linear acyclic causalmodels are commonly used to model the data-generating process, and theinference of such models is a well-studied problem. However, existing methodshave significant limitations. Methods based on conditional independencies(Spirtes et al. 1993; Pearl 2000) cannot distinguish betweenindependence-equivalent models, whereas approaches purely based on IndependentComponent Analysis (Shimizu et al. 2006) are inapplicable to data which ispartially Gaussian. In this paper, we generalize and combine the twoapproaches, to yield a method able to learn the model structure in many casesfor which the previous methods provide answers that are either incorrect or arenot as informative as possible. We give exact graphical conditions for when twodistinct models represent the same family of distributions, and empiricallydemonstrate the power of our method through thorough simulations.

Jebara category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:A Bayesian treatment of latent directed graph structure for non-iid data isprovided where each child datum is sampled with a directed conditionaldependence on a single unknown parent datum. The latent graph structure isassumed to lie in the family of directed out-tree graphs which leads toefficient Bayesian inference. The latent likelihood of the data and itsgradients are computable in closed form via Tutte's directed matrix treetheorem using determinants and inverses of the out-Laplacian. This novellikelihood subsumes iid likelihood, is exchangeable and yields efficientunsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. In addition to handlingtaxonomy and phylogenetic datasets the out-tree assumption performssurprisingly well as a semi-parametric density estimator on standard iiddatasets. Experiments with unsupervised and semisupervised learning are shownon various UCI and taxonomy datasets.

Frey category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:We introduce a new type of graphical model called a "cumulative distributionnetwork" (CDN), which expresses a joint cumulative distribution as a product oflocal functions. Each local function can be viewed as providing evidence aboutpossible orderings, or rankings, of variables. Interestingly, we find that theconditional independence properties of CDNs are quite different from othergraphical models. We also describe a messagepassing algorithm that efficientlycomputes conditional cumulative distributions. Due to the unique independenceproperties of the CDN, these messages do not in general have a one-to-onecorrespondence with messages exchanged in standard algorithms, such as beliefpropagation. We demonstrate the application of CDNs for structured rankinglearning using a previously-studied multi-player gaming dataset.
arxiv-1206-3274 | Small Sample Inference for Generalization Error in Classification Using the CUD Bound |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3274  | author:Eric B. Laber, Susan A. Murphy category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:Confidence measures for the generalization error are crucial when smalltraining samples are used to construct classifiers. A common approach is toestimate the generalization error by resampling and then assume the resampledestimator follows a known distribution to form a confidence set [Kohavi 1995,Martin 1996,Yang 2006]. Alternatively, one might bootstrap the resampledestimator of the generalization error to form a confidence set. Unfortunately,these methods do not reliably provide sets of the desired confidence. The poorperformance appears to be due to the lack of smoothness of the generalizationerror as a function of the learned classifier. This results in a non-normaldistribution of the estimated generalization error. We construct a confidenceset for the generalization error by use of a smooth upper bound on thedeviation between the resampled estimate and generalization error. Theconfidence set is formed by bootstrapping this upper bound. In cases in whichthe approximation class for the classifier can be represented as a parametricadditive model, we provide a computationally efficient algorithm. This methodexhibits superior performance across a series of test and simulated data sets.

Sutton, Csaba Szepesvari, Alborz Geramifard, Michael P. Bowling category:cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY published:2012-06-13 summary:We consider the problem of efficiently learning optimal control policies andvalue functions over large state spaces in an online setting in which estimatesmust be available after each interaction with the world. This paper develops anexplicitly model-based approach extending the Dyna architecture to linearfunction approximation. Dynastyle planning proceeds by generating imaginaryexperience from the world model and then applying model-free reinforcementlearning algorithms to the imagined state transitions. Our main results are toprove that linear Dyna-style planning converges to a unique solutionindependent of the generating distribution, under natural conditions. In thepolicy evaluation setting, we prove that the limit point is the least-squares(LSTD) solution. An implication of our results is that prioritized-sweeping canbe soundly extended to the linear approximation case, backing up to precedingfeatures rather than to preceding states. We introduce two versions ofprioritized sweeping with linear Dyna and briefly illustrate their performanceempirically on the Mountain Car and Boyan Chain problems.
arxiv-1206-3297 | Hybrid Variational/Gibbs Collapsed Inference in Topic Models |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3297  | author:Max Welling, Yee Whye Teh, Hilbert Kappen category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:Variational Bayesian inference and (collapsed) Gibbs sampling are the twoimportant classes of inference algorithms for Bayesian networks. Both havetheir advantages and disadvantages: collapsed Gibbs sampling is unbiased but isalso inefficient for large count values and requires averaging over manysamples to reduce variance. On the other hand, variational Bayesian inferenceis efficient and accurate for large count values but suffers from bias forsmall counts. We propose a hybrid algorithm that combines the best of bothworlds: it samples very small counts and applies variational updates to largecounts. This hybridization is shown to significantly improve testset perplexityrelative to variational inference at no computational cost.

Guimarães, Jean Cousty, Yukiko Kenmochi, Laurent Najman category:cs.CV published:2012-06-13 summary:Hierarchical image segmentation provides region-oriented scalespace, i.e., aset of image segmentations at different detail levels in which thesegmentations at finer levels are nested with respect to those at coarserlevels. Most image segmentation algorithms, such as region merging algorithms,rely on a criterion for merging that does not lead to a hierarchy, and forwhich the tuning of the parameters can be difficult. In this work, we propose ahierarchical graph based image segmentation relying on a criterion popularizedby Felzenzwalb and Huttenlocher. We illustrate with both real and syntheticimages, showing efficiency, ease of use, and robustness of our method.
arxiv-1206-2944 | Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2944  | author:Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle, Ryan P. Adams category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2012-06-13 summary:Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of modelhyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters.Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expertexperience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Muchmore appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which canoptimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. Inthis work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework ofBayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalizationperformance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractableposterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of theinformation gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices aboutwhat parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussianprocess prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact onthe success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtfulchoices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuningmachine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take intoaccount the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that canleverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We showthat these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and canreach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set ofcontemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMsand convolutional neural networks.
arxiv-1206-3294 | Flexible Priors for Exemplar-based Clustering |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3294  | author:Daniel Tarlow, Richard S. Zemel, Brendan J. Frey category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:Exemplar-based clustering methods have been shown to produce state-of-the-artresults on a number of synthetic and real-world clustering problems. They areappealing because they offer computational benefits over latent-mean models andcan handle arbitrary pairwise similarity measures between data points. However,when trying to recover underlying structure in clustering problems, tailoredsimilarity measures are often not enough; we also desire control over thedistribution of cluster sizes. Priors such as Dirichlet process priors allowthe number of clusters to be unspecified while expressing priors over datapartitions. To our knowledge, they have not been applied to exemplar-basedmodels. We show how to incorporate priors, including Dirichlet process priors,into the recently introduced affinity propagation algorithm. We develop anefficient maxproduct belief propagation algorithm for our new model anddemonstrate experimentally how the expanded range of clustering priors allowsus to better recover true clusterings in situations where we have someinformation about the generating process.

Cowell category:cs.AI cs.CL published:2012-06-13 summary:A Chain Event Graph (CEG) is a graphial model which designed to embodyconditional independencies in problems whose state spaces are highly asymmetricand do not admit a natural product structure. In this paer we present aprobability propagation algorithm which uses the topology of the CEG to build atransporter CEG. Intriungly,the transporter CEG is directly analogous to thetriangulated Bayesian Network (BN) in the more conventional junction treepropagation algorithms used with BNs. The propagation method uses factorizationformulae also analogous to (but different from) the ones using potentials oncliques and separators of the BN. It appears that the methods will be typicallymore efficient than the BN algorithms when applied to contexts where there issignificant asymmetry present.

Rao category:stat.AP cs.IT math.IT stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:Telemonitoring of electroencephalogram (EEG) through wireless body-areanetworks is an evolving direction in personalized medicine. Among variousconstraints in designing such a system, three important constraints are energyconsumption, data compression, and device cost. Conventional data compressionmethodologies, although effective in data compression, consumes significantenergy and cannot reduce device cost. Compressed sensing (CS), as an emergingdata compression methodology, is promising in catering to these constraints.However, EEG is non-sparse in the time domain and also non-sparse intransformed domains (such as the wavelet domain). Therefore, it is extremelydifficult for current CS algorithms to recover EEG with the quality thatsatisfies the requirements of clinical diagnosis and engineering applications.Recently, Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) was proposed as a new method tothe CS problem. This study introduces the technique to the telemonitoring ofEEG. Experimental results show that its recovery quality is better thanstate-of-the-art CS algorithms, and sufficient for practical use. These resultssuggest that BSBL is very promising for telemonitoring of EEG and othernon-sparse physiological signals.

This paper discusses a verysimple and efficient algorithm to learn the chordal structure of aprobabilistic model from data. The algorithm is a greedy hill-climbing searchalgorithm that uses the inclusion boundary neighborhood over chordal graphs. Inthe limit of a large sample size and under appropriate hypotheses on thescoring criterion, we prove that the algorithm will find a structure that isinclusion-optimal when the dependency model of the data-generating distributioncan be represented exactly by an undirected graph. The algorithm is evaluatedon simulated datasets.

Here weuse clique matrices to decompose a graph into a set of possibly overlappingclusters, de ned as well-connected subsets of vertices. The decomposition isbased on a statistical description which encourages clusters to be wellconnected and few in number. Inference is carried out using a variationalapproximation. Clique matrices also play a natural role in parameterisingpositive de nite matrices under zero constraints on elements of the matrix. Weshow that clique matrices can parameterise all positive de nite matricesrestricted according to a decomposable graph and form a structured FactorAnalysis approximation in the non-decomposable case.
arxiv-1206-3262 | Convergent Message-Passing Algorithms for Inference over General Graphs with Convex Free Energies |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3262  | author:Tamir Hazan, Amnon Shashua category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:Inference problems in graphical models can be represented as a constrainedoptimization of a free energy function. It is known that when the Bethe freeenergy is used, the fixedpoints of the belief propagation (BP) algorithmcorrespond to the local minima of the free energy. However BP fails to convergein many cases of interest. Moreover, the Bethe free energy is non-convex forgraphical models with cycles thus introducing great difficulty in derivingefficient algorithms for finding local minima of the free energy for generalgraphs. In this paper we introduce two efficient BP-like algorithms, onesequential and the other parallel, that are guaranteed to converge to theglobal minimum, for any graph, over the class of energies known as "convex freeenergies". In addition, we propose an efficient heuristic for setting theparameters of the convex free energy based on the structure of the graph.

Replacing exact inference with approximate methods such as loopybelief propagation (LBP) can suffer from poor convergence. In this paper, weprovide a different approach for combining MRF learning and Betheapproximation. We consider the dual of maximum likelihood Markov networklearning - maximizing entropy with moment matching constraints - and thenapproximate both the objective and the constraints in the resultingoptimization problem. Unlike previous work along these lines (Teh & Welling,2003), our formulation allows parameter sharing between features in a generallog-linear model, parameter regularization and conditional training. We showthat piecewise training (Sutton & McCallum, 2005) is a very restricted specialcase of this formulation. We study two optimization strategies: one based on asingle convex approximation and one that uses repeated convex approximations.We show results on several real-world networks that demonstrate that thesealgorithms can significantly outperform learning with loopy and piecewise. Ourresults also provide a framework for analyzing the trade-offs of differentrelaxations of the entropy objective and of the constraints.
arxiv-1206-3238 | Greedy Block Coordinate Descent for Large Scale Gaussian Process Regression |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3238  | author:Liefeng Bo, Cristian Sminchisescu category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:We propose a variable decomposition algorithm -greedy block coordinatedescent (GBCD)- in order to make dense Gaussian process regression practicalfor large scale problems. GBCD breaks a large scale optimization into a seriesof small sub-problems. The challenge in variable decomposition algorithms isthe identification of a subproblem (the active set of variables) that yieldsthe largest improvement. We analyze the limitations of existing methods andcast the active set selection into a zero-norm constrained optimization problemthat we solve using greedy methods. By directly estimating the decrease in theobjective function, we obtain not only efficient approximate solutions forGBCD, but we are also able to demonstrate that the method is globallyconvergent. Empirical comparisons against competing dense methods likeConjugate Gradient or SMO show that GBCD is an order of magnitude faster.Comparisons against sparse GP methods show that GBCD is both accurate andcapable of handling datasets of 100,000 samples or more.
arxiv-1206-3290 | Modelling local and global phenomena with sparse Gaussian processes |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3290  | author:Jarno Vanhatalo, Aki Vehtari category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:Much recent work has concerned sparse approximations to speed up the Gaussianprocess regression from the unfavorable O(n3) scaling in computational time toO(nm2). Thus far, work has concentrated on models with one covariance function.However, in many practical situations additive models with multiple covariancefunctions may perform better, since the data may contain both long and shortlength-scale phenomena. The long length-scales can be captured with globalsparse approximations, such as fully independent conditional (FIC), and theshort length-scales can be modeled naturally by covariance functions withcompact support (CS). CS covariance functions lead to naturally sparsecovariance matrices, which are computationally cheaper to handle than fullcovariance matrices. In this paper, we propose a new sparse Gaussian processmodel with two additive components: FIC for the long length-scales and CScovariance function for the short length-scales. We give theoretical andexperimental results and show that under certain conditions the proposed modelhas the same computational complexity as FIC. We also compare the modelperformance of the proposed model to additive models approximated by fully andpartially independent conditional (PIC). We use real data sets and show thatour model outperforms FIC and PIC approximations for data sets with twoadditive phenomena.
arxiv-1206-3279 | The Phylogenetic Indian Buffet Process: A Non-Exchangeable Nonparametric Prior for Latent Features |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3279  | author:Kurt T. Miller, Thomas Griffiths, Michael I. Jordan category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:Nonparametric Bayesian models are often based on the assumption that theobjects being modeled are exchangeable. While appropriate in some applications(e.g., bag-of-words models for documents), exchangeability is sometimes assumedsimply for computational reasons; non-exchangeable models might be a betterchoice for applications based on subject matter. Drawing on ideas fromgraphical models and phylogenetics, we describe a non-exchangeable prior for aclass of nonparametric latent feature models that is nearly as efficientcomputationally as its exchangeable counterpart. Our model is applicable to thegeneral setting in which the dependencies between objects can be expressedusing a tree, where edge lengths indicate the strength of relationships. Wedemonstrate an application to modeling probabilistic choice.

The approach leads to an intuitiveframework in which one can trade-off the quality of an approximation with thecomplexity of computing it. It also includes the Bethe free energyapproximation as a degenerate case. We develop the approach theoretically inthis paper and provide a number of empirical results that reveal its practicalutility.

Some of these problems have instances that can befactored into multiple views, each of which is nearly sufficent in determiningthe correct labels. In this paper we present a new algorithm for probabilisticmulti-view learning which uses the idea of stochastic agreement between viewsas regularization. Our algorithm works on structured and unstructured problemsand easily generalizes to partial agreement scenarios. For the full agreementcase, our algorithm minimizes the Bhattacharyya distance between the models ofeach view, and performs better than CoBoosting and two-view Perceptron onseveral flat and structured classification problems.

Christoudias, Raquel Urtasun, Trevor Darrell category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-13 summary:Traditional multi-view learning approaches suffer in the presence of viewdisagreement,i.e., when samples in each view do not belong to the same classdue to view corruption, occlusion or other noise processes. In this paper wepresent a multi-view learning approach that uses a conditional entropycriterion to detect view disagreement. Once detected, samples with viewdisagreement are filtered and standard multi-view learning methods can besuccessfully applied to the remaining samples. Experimental evaluation onsynthetic and audio-visual databases demonstrates that the detection andfiltering of view disagreement considerably increases the performance oftraditional multi-view learning approaches.

We give necessaryconditions for the Gaussian fractional Bethe free energies to be bounded frombelow. It turns out that the bounding condition is the same as the pairwisenormalizability condition derived by Malioutov et al. (2006) as a sufficientcondition for the convergence of the message passing algorithm. By giving acounterexample, we disprove the conjecture in Welling and Teh (2001): even whenthe Bethe free energy is not bounded from below, it can possess a local minimumto which the minimization algorithms can converge.

In our first contribution, wetheoretically analyze the case of large ESS-values, which complements previouswork: among other results, we find that the presence of an edge in a Bayesiannetwork is favoured over its absence even if both the Dirichlet prior and thedata imply independence, as long as the conditional empirical distribution isnotably different from uniform. In our second contribution, we focus onrealistic ESS-values, and provide an analytical approximation to the "optimal"ESS-value in a predictive sense (its accuracy is also validatedexperimentally): this approximation provides an understanding as to whichproperties of the data have the main effect determining the "optimal"ESS-value.

ThecDTM is a dynamic topic model that uses Brownian motion to model the latenttopics through a sequential collection of documents, where a "topic" is apattern of word use that we expect to evolve over the course of the collection.We derive an efficient variational approximate inference algorithm that takesadvantage of the sparsity of observations in text, a property that lets useasily handle many time points. In contrast to the cDTM, the originaldiscrete-time dynamic topic model (dDTM) requires that time be discretized.Moreover, the complexity of variational inference for the dDTM grows quickly astime granularity increases, a drawback which limits fine-graineddiscretization. We demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting bothpredictive perplexity and the novel task of time stamp prediction.

However, this approachsuffers difficulties when either the inference process or the model isapproximate. In this paper, the inference process is first defined to be theminimization of a convex function, inspired by free energy approximations.Learning is then done directly in terms of the performance of the inferenceprocess at univariate marginal prediction. The main novelty is that this is adirect minimization of emperical risk, where the risk measures the accuracy ofpredicted marginals.

In this paper we tackle the problem of learning a sparse GMRF ina high-dimensional space. Our approach uses the l1-norm as a regularization onthe inverse covariance matrix. We utilize a novel projected gradient method,which is faster than previous methods in practice and equal to the bestperforming of these in asymptotic complexity. We also extend the l1-regularizedobjective to the problem of sparsifying entire blocks within the inversecovariance matrix. Our methods generalize fairly easily to this case, whileother methods do not. We demonstrate that our extensions give bettergeneralization performance on two real domains--biological network analysis anda 2D-shape modeling image task.

As fully Bayesian computationscan be difficult and computationally demanding, it is often desirable to useposterior point estimates that facilitate (relatively) efficient prediction.However, the hierarchical Bayes framework does not always lend itself naturallyto this maximum aposteriori goal. In this work we propose an undirectedreformulation of hierarchical Bayes that relies on priors in the form ofsimilarity measures. We introduce the notion of "degree of transfer" weights oncomponents of these similarity measures, and show how they can be automaticallylearned within a joint probabilistic framework. Importantly, our reformulationresults in a convex objective for many learning problems, thus facilitatingoptimal posterior point estimation using standard optimization techniques. Inaddition, we no longer require proper priors, allowing for flexible andstraightforward specification of joint distributions over transfer hierarchies.We show that our framework is effective for learning models that are part oftransfer hierarchies for two real-life tasks: object shape modeling usingGaussian density estimation and document classification.

With the proliferation ofhypertext document collection such as the Internet, there has also been greatinterest in extending these approaches to hypertext [6, 9]. These approachestypically model links in an analogous fashion to how they model words - thedocument-link co-occurrence matrix is modeled in the same way that thedocument-word co-occurrence matrix is modeled in standard topic models. In thispaper we present a probabilistic generative model for hypertext documentcollections that explicitly models the generation of links. Specifically, linksfrom a word w to a document d depend directly on how frequent the topic of w isin d, in addition to the in-degree of d. We show how to perform EM learning onthis model efficiently. By not modeling links as analogous to words, we end upusing far fewer free parameters and obtain better link prediction results.
arxiv-1206-2627 | Image Similarity Using Sparse Representation and Compression Distance |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2627  | author:Tanaya Guha, Rabab K. Ward category:cs.CV published:2012-06-12 summary:A new line of research uses compression methods to measure the similaritybetween signals. Two signals are considered similar if one can be compressedsignificantly when the information of the other is known. The existingcompression-based similarity methods, although successful in the discrete onedimensional domain, do not work well in the context of images. This paperproposes a sparse representation-based approach to encode the informationcontent of an image using information from the other image, and uses thecompactness (sparsity) of the representation as a measure of itscompressibility (how much can the image be compressed) with respect to theother image. The more sparse the representation of an image, the better it canbe compressed and the more it is similar to the other image. The efficacy ofthe proposed measure is demonstrated through the high accuracies achieved inimage clustering, retrieval and classification.

Itwas introduced by R\'enyi as a measure of information that satisfies almost thesame axioms as Kullback-Leibler divergence, and depends on a parameter that iscalled its order. In particular, the R\'enyi divergence of order 1 equals theKullback-Leibler divergence. We review and extend the most important properties of R\'enyi divergence andKullback-Leibler divergence, including convexity, continuity, limits of$\sigma$-algebras and the relation of the special order 0 to the Gaussiandichotomy and contiguity. We also show how to generalize the Pythagoreaninequality to orders different from 1, and we extend the known equivalencebetween channel capacity and minimax redundancy to continuous channel inputs(for all orders) and present several other minimax results.

A sufficient condition that OMPcan recover the optimal representation of an exactly sparse signal in thecomplex cases is proposed both in noiseless and bound Gaussian noise settings.Similar to exact recovery condition (ERC) results in real cases, we extend themto complex case and derivate the corresponding ERC in the paper.

Besides, an application with geometrical theory ofdiffraction (GTD) model is presented for complex cases. Finally, simulationexperiments illustrate the validity of the theoretical analysis.

In this paper we propose an improved cross-validationprocedure which uses nonparametric testing coupled with sequential analysis todetermine the best parameter set on linearly increasing subsets of the data. Byeliminating underperforming candidates quickly and keeping promising candidatesas long as possible, the method speeds up the computation while preserving thecapability of the full cross-validation.

arxiv-1206-2058 | Dimension Reduction by Mutual Information Discriminant Analysis |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2058  | author:Ali Shadvar category:cs.CV cs.IT cs.LG math.IT published:2012-06-10 summary:In the past few decades, researchers have proposed many discriminant analysis(DA) algorithms for the study of high-dimensional data in a variety ofproblems. Most DA algorithms for feature extraction are based ontransformations that simultaneously maximize the between-class scatter andminimize the withinclass scatter matrices. This paper presents a novel DAalgorithm for feature extraction using mutual information (MI). However, it isnot always easy to obtain an accurate estimation for high-dimensional MI. Inthis paper, we propose an efficient method for feature extraction that is basedon one-dimensional MI estimations. We will refer to this algorithm as mutualinformation discriminant analysis (MIDA). The performance of this proposedmethod was evaluated using UCI databases. The results indicate that MIDAprovides robust performance over different data sets with differentcharacteristics and that MIDA always performs better than, or at leastcomparable to, the best performing algorithms.

Kingravi, Fatih Celiker category:cs.NA cs.CV G.1.2; I.5 published:2012-06-10 summary:Mukherjee (Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 32, pp. 824-831, 2011) recentlyintroduced a class of distance functions called weighted t-cost distances thatgeneralize m-neighbor, octagonal, and t-cost distances. He proved that weightedt-cost distances form a family of metrics and derived an approximation for theEuclidean norm in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. In this note we compare this approximation totwo previously proposed Euclidean norm approximations and demonstrate that theempirical average errors given by Mukherjee are significantly optimistic in$\mathbb{R}^n$. We also propose a simple normalization scheme that improves theaccuracy of his approximation substantially with respect to both average andmaximum relative errors.

The resulting image will have anextremely wide field of view covering up to 4{\pi} steradians of the sphericalpanorama. We argue that our method complements the stereographic projectioncommonly used in the "little planet" effect. The stereographic projection workswell in creating little planets of outdoor scenes; whereas our method is awell-suited counterpart for indoor scenes. The main innovation of our method isthe introduction of a novel azimuthal map projection that can smoothly blendbetween the stereographic projection and the Lambert azimuthal equal-areaprojection. Our projection has an adjustable parameter that allows one tocontrol and compromise between distortions in shape and distortions in sizewithin the projected panorama. This extra control parameter gives ourprojection the ability to produce superior results over the stereographicprojection.

Ortega, Jordi Grau-Moya, Tim Genewein, David Balduzzi, Daniel A. Braun category:stat.ML cs.AI math.ST stat.TH published:2012-06-09 summary:We propose a novel Bayesian approach to solve stochastic optimizationproblems that involve finding extrema of noisy, nonlinear functions. Previouswork has focused on representing possible functions explicitly, which leads toa two-step procedure of first, doing inference over the function space andsecond, finding the extrema of these functions. Here we skip the representationstep and directly model the distribution over extrema. To this end, we devise anon-parametric conjugate prior based on a kernel regressor. The resultingposterior distribution directly captures the uncertainty over the maximum ofthe unknown function. We illustrate the effectiveness of our model byoptimizing a noisy, high-dimensional, non-convex objective function.

The proposed methodology uses a three layer feedforward neural network with back propagation as sequential learning procedureto find numerical solutions of a class of Diophantine equations. It uses adynamically constructed network architecture where number of nodes in the inputlayer is chosen based on the number of variables in the equation. The powers ofthe given Diophantine equation are taken as input to the input layer. Thetraining of the network starts with initial random integral weights. Theweights are updated based on the back propagation of the error values at theoutput layer. The optimization of weights is augmented by adding a momentumfactor into the network. The optimized weights of the connection between theinput layer and the hidden layer are taken as numerical solution of the givenDiophantine equation. The procedure is validated using different DiophantineEquations of different number of variables and different powers.

To produce more appropriateclusterings, we introduce a model which warps a latent mixture of Gaussians toproduce nonparametric cluster shapes. The possibly low-dimensional latentmixture model allows us to summarize the properties of the high-dimensionalclusters (or density manifolds) describing the data. The number of manifolds,as well as the shape and dimension of each manifold is automatically inferred.We derive a simple inference scheme for this model which analyticallyintegrates out both the mixture parameters and the warping function. We showthat our model is effective for density estimation, performs better thaninfinite Gaussian mixture models at recovering the true number of clusters, andproduces interpretable summaries of high-dimensional datasets.

This distribution isdiscussed in the framework of the exponential family, and its statisticalproperties regarding independence of the nodes are demonstrated. Importantlythe model can estimate not only the main effects and pairwise interactionsamong the nodes but also is capable of modeling higher order interactions,allowing for the existence of complex clique effects. We compare themultivariate Bernoulli model with existing graphical inference models - theIsing model and the multivariate Gaussian model, where only the pairwiseinteractions are considered. On the other hand, the multivariate Bernoullidistribution has an interesting property in that independence anduncorrelatedness of the component random variables are equivalent. Both themarginal and conditional distributions of a subset of variables in themultivariate Bernoulli distribution still follow the multivariate Bernoullidistribution. Furthermore, the multivariate Bernoulli logistic model isdeveloped under generalized linear model theory by utilizing the canonical linkfunction in order to include covariate information on the nodes, edges andcliques. We also consider variable selection techniques such as LASSO in thelogistic model to impose sparsity structure on the graph. Finally, we discussextending the smoothing spline ANOVA approach to the multivariate Bernoullilogistic model to enable estimation of non-linear effects of the predictorvariables.

The proposed algorithm uses a fixed 3x3 window for theincreasing noise densities. The pixels in the current window are arranged insorting order using a improved snake like sorting algorithm with reducedcomparator. The processed pixel is checked for the occurrence of outliers, ifthe absolute difference between processed pixels is greater than fixedthreshold. Under high noise densities the processed pixel is also noisy hencethe median is checked using the above procedure. if found true then the pixelis considered as noisy hence the corrupted pixel is replaced by the median ofthe current processing window. If median is also noisy then replace thecorrupted pixel with unsymmetrical trimmed median else if the pixel is termeduncorrupted and left unaltered. The proposed algorithm (PA) is tested onvarying detail images for various noises. The proposed algorithm effectivelyremoves the high density fixed value impulse noise, low density random valuedimpulse noise, low density Gaussian noise and lower proportion of mixed noise.The proposed algorithm is targeted on Xc3e5000-5fg900 FPGA using Xilinx 7.1compiler version which requires less number of slices, optimum speed and lowpower when compared to the other median finding architectures.

Reading means that the computer is given apiece of handwriting and it provides the electronic transcription of that (e.g.in ASCII format). Two types of handwriting: on-line and offline. The mostimportant purpose of off-line handwriting recognition is in protection systemsand authentication. Arabic Handwriting scripts are much more complicated incomparison to Latin scripts. This paper introduces a simple and novelmethodology to authenticate Arabic handwriting characters. Reaching our aim, webuilt our own character database. The research methodology depends on twostages: The first is character extraction where preprocessing the word and thenapply segmentation process to obtain the character. The second is the characterrecognition by matching the characters comprising the word with the letters inthe database. Our results ensure character recognition with 81%. We eliminateFAR by using similarity percent between 45-55%. Our research is coded usingMATLAB.

Many popular methods tailored to problems arising in bioinformatics,signal processing, and statistical learning are special cases of proximalNewton-type methods, and our analysis yields new convergence results for someof these methods.

It is one of themost successful techniques in face recognition. But it has drawback of highcomputational especially for big size database. This paper conducts a study tooptimize the time complexity of PCA (eigenfaces) that does not affects therecognition performance.

A comparison is done tocompare the differences between the recognition time in the original algorithmand in the enhanced algorithm. The performance of the original and the enhancedproposed algorithm is tested on face94 face database. Experimental results showthat the recognition time is reduced by 35% by applying our proposed enhancedalgorithm. DET Curves are used to illustrate the experimental results.

There are, however, contradicting findings which raise question overusefulness of ANNs. This paper discusses development of three neural networksfor modeling consumer e-commerce behavior and compares the findings toequivalent logistic regression models. The results showed that ANNs predicte-commerce adoption slightly more accurately than logistic models but this ishardly justifiable given the added complexity. Further, ANNs seem to be highlyadaptive, particularly when a small sample is coupled with a large number ofnodes in hidden layers which, in turn, limits the neural networks'generalisability.

Ouralgorithm is a "forward-backward" greedy procedure that -- uniquely -- operateson two distinct classes of objects. In particular, we organize our targetsparse vectors as a matrix; our algorithm involves iterative addition andremoval of both (a) individual elements, and (b) entire rows (corresponding toshared features), of the matrix. Analytically, we establish that our algorithm manages to recover the supports(exactly) and values (approximately) of the sparse vectors, under assumptionssimilar to existing approaches based on convex optimization. However, ouralgorithm has a much smaller computational complexity. Perhaps mostinterestingly, it is seen empirically to require visibly fewer samples. Oursrepresents the first attempt to extend greedy algorithms to the class of modelsthat can only/best be represented by a combination of component structuralassumptions (sparse and group-sparse, in our case).

We propose a method toautomatically adjust multiple learning rates so as to minimize the expectederror at any one time. The method relies on local gradient variations acrosssamples. In our approach, learning rates can increase as well as decrease,making it suitable for non-stationary problems. Using a number of convex andnon-convex learning tasks, we show that the resulting algorithm matches theperformance of SGD or other adaptive approaches with their best settingsobtained through systematic search, and effectively removes the need forlearning rate tuning.

In particular, the case of deflection bymeans of Solar-pumped Laser ablation is studied here in detail. The basic ideabehind Laser ablation is that of inducing a sublimation of the NEO surface,which produces a low thrust thereby slowly deviating the asteroid from itsinitial Earth threatening trajectory. This work investigates the integrateddesign of the Space-based Laser system and the deflection action generated bylaser ablation under uncertainty. The integrated design is formulated as amulti-objective optimisation problem in which the deviation is maximised andthe total system mass is minimised. Both the model for the estimation of thethrust produced by surface laser ablation and the spacecraft system model areassumed to be affected by epistemic uncertainties (partial or complete lack ofknowledge). Evidence Theory is used to quantify these uncertainties andintroduce them in the optimisation process. The propagation of the trajectoryof the NEO under the laser-ablation action is performed with a novel approachbased on an approximated analytical solution of Gauss' Variational Equations.An example of design of the deflection of asteroid Apophis with a swarm ofspacecraft is presented.

This convex optimization problem aims to estimate an inversecovariance matrix that can be decomposed into a sparse matrix minus a low-rankmatrix from sample data. Solving this convex optimization problem is verychallenging, especially for large problems. In this paper, we propose twoalternating direction methods for solving this problem. The first method is toapply the classical alternating direction method of multipliers to solve theproblem as a consensus problem. The second method is a proximal gradient basedalternating direction method of multipliers. Our methods exploit and takeadvantage of the special structure of the problem and thus can solve largeproblems very efficiently. Global convergence result is established for theproposed methods. Numerical results on both synthetic data and gene expressiondata show that our methods usually solve problems with one million variables inone to two minutes, and are usually five to thirty five times faster than astate-of-the-art Newton-CG proximal point algorithm.

A population of agents combines heuristicsthat aim at exploring the search space both globally and in a neighborhood ofeach agent. These heuristics are complemented with a combination of a local andglobal archive. The novel agent- based algorithm is tested at first on a set ofstandard problems and then on three specific problems in space trajectorydesign. Its performance is compared against a number of state-of-the-artmultiobjective optimisation algorithms that use the Pareto dominance asselection criterion: NSGA-II, PAES, MOPSO, MTS. The results demonstrate thatthe agent-based search can identify parts of the Pareto set that the otheralgorithms were not able to capture. Furthermore, convergence is statisticallybetter although the variance of the results is in some cases higher.
arxiv-1206-1270 | Factoring nonnegative matrices with linear programs |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1270  | author:Victor Bittorf, Benjamin Recht, Christopher Re, Joel A. Tropp category:math.OC cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-06-06 summary:This paper describes a new approach, based on linear programming, forcomputing nonnegative matrix factorizations (NMFs). The key idea is adata-driven model for the factorization where the most salient features in thedata are used to express the remaining features. More precisely, given a datamatrix X, the algorithm identifies a matrix C such that X approximately equalsCX and some linear constraints. The constraints are chosen to ensure that thematrix C selects features; these features can then be used to find a low-rankNMF of X. A theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach has guaranteessimilar to those of the recent NMF algorithm of Arora et al. (2012). Incontrast with this earlier work, the proposed method extends to more generalnoise models and leads to efficient, scalable algorithms. Experiments withsynthetic and real datasets provide evidence that the new approach is alsosuperior in practice. An optimized C++ implementation can factor amultigigabyte matrix in a matter of minutes.

Recent training algorithmsfor LDA can be interpreted within a unified message passing framework. However,message passing requires storing previous messages with a large amount ofmemory space, increasing linearly with the number of documents or the number oftopics. Therefore, the high memory usage is often a major problem for topicmodeling of massive corpora containing a large number of topics. To reduce thespace complexity, we propose a novel algorithm without storing previousmessages for training LDA: tiny belief propagation (TBP). The basic idea of TBPrelates the message passing algorithms with the non-negative matrixfactorization (NMF) algorithms, which absorb the message updating into themessage passing process, and thus avoid storing previous messages. Experimentalresults on four large data sets confirm that TBP performs comparably well oreven better than current state-of-the-art training algorithms for LDA but witha much less memory consumption. TBP can do topic modeling when massive corporacannot fit in the computer memory, for example, extracting thematic topics from7 GB PUBMED corpora on a common desktop computer with 2GB memory.

The purpose of theproject is to verify the predictive effectiveness of the two techniques onreal, historical data. Besides the performance outcome that renders J48marginally better than the Naive Bayes technique, there is a detaileddescription of the data and the required pre-processing activities. Theperformance results confirm expectations while some of the issues that appearedduring experimentation, underscore the value of having domain-specificunderstanding to leverage any domain-specific characteristics inherent in thedata.

Thesemethods are mostly based on L1-regularized optimization which has a number ofdisadvantages such as the inability to assess model uncertainty and expensivecross-validation to find the optimal regularization parameter. Moreover, themodel's predictive performance may degrade dramatically with a suboptimal valueof the regularization parameter (which is sometimes desirable to inducesparseness). We propose a fully Bayesian approach based on a "spike and slab"prior (similar to L0 regularization) that does not suffer from theseshortcomings. We develop an approximate MCMC method combining Langevin dynamicsand reversible jump MCMC to conduct inference in this model. Experiments showthat the proposed model learns a good combination of the structure andparameter values without the need for separate hyper-parameter tuning.Moreover, the model's predictive performance is much more robust than L1-basedmethods with hyper-parameter settings that induce highly sparse modelstructures.

Particularly in high-dimensionalapplications, this is often not the case. This paper develops efficientOMP-like algorithms to deal with precisely this setting. Our algorithms are asefficient as OMP, and improve on the best-known results for missing and noisydata in regression, both in the high-dimensional setting where we seek torecover a sparse vector from only a few measurements, and in the classicallow-dimensional setting where we recover an unstructured regressor. In thehigh-dimensional setting, our support-recovery algorithm requires no knowledgeof even the statistics of the noise. Along the way, we also obtain improvedperformance guarantees for OMP for the standard sparse regression problem withGaussian noise.

As a result, a memetic ABC (MABC)algorithm has been developed that is hybridized with two local searchheuristics: the Nelder-Mead algorithm (NMA) and the random walk with directionexploitation (RWDE). The former is attended more towards exploration, while thelatter more towards exploitation of the search space. The stochastic adaptationrule was employed in order to control the balancing between exploration andexploitation. This MABC algorithm was applied to a Special suite on Large ScaleContinuous Global Optimization at the 2012 IEEE Congress on EvolutionaryComputation. The obtained results the MABC are comparable with the results ofDECC-G, DECC-G*, and MLCC.

Despite the wideapplicability of such a detection algorithm, there has been little success inthe development of computationally feasible methods with proveable theoreticalguarantees for general graph topologies. We cast this as a hypothesis testingproblem, and first provide a universal necessary condition for asymptoticdistinguishability of the null and alternative hypotheses. We then introducethe spanning tree wavelet basis over graphs, a localized basis that reflectsthe topology of the graph, and prove that for any spanning tree, this approachcan distinguish null from alternative in a low signal-to-noise regime. Lastly,we improve on this result and show that using the uniform spanning tree in thebasis construction yields a randomized test with stronger theoreticalguarantees that in many cases matches our necessary conditions. Specifically,we obtain near-optimal performance in edge transitive graphs, $k$-nearestneighbor graphs, and $\epsilon$-graphs.

We point out the relation of our approach, which is basedon an ontology of a concept as an entity in a state changing under influence ofa context, with the main traditional concept theories, i.e. prototype theory,exemplar theory and theory theory. We ponder about the question why quantumtheory performs so well in its modeling of human concepts, and shed light onthis question by analyzing the role of complex amplitudes, showing how theyallow to describe interference in the statistics of measurement outcomes, whilein the traditional theories statistics of outcomes originates in classicalprobability weights, without the possibility of interference. The relevance ofcomplex numbers, the appearance of entanglement, and the role of Fock space inexplaining contextual emergence, all as unique features of the quantummodeling, are explicitly revealed in this paper by analyzing human concepts andtheir dynamics.
arxiv-1206-0985 | Nearly optimal solutions for the Chow Parameters Problem and low-weight approximation of halfspaces |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0985  | author:Anindya De, Ilias Diakonikolas, Vitaly Feldman, Rocco A. Servedio category:cs.CC cs.DS cs.LG published:2012-06-05 summary:The \emph{Chow parameters} of a Boolean function $f: \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}$are its $n+1$ degree-0 and degree-1 Fourier coefficients. It has been knownsince 1961 (Chow, Tannenbaum) that the (exact values of the) Chow parameters ofany linear threshold function $f$ uniquely specify $f$ within the space of allBoolean functions, but until recently (O'Donnell and Servedio) nothing wasknown about efficient algorithms for \emph{reconstructing} $f$ (exactly orapproximately) from exact or approximate values of its Chow parameters. Werefer to this reconstruction problem as the \emph{Chow Parameters Problem.} Our main result is a new algorithm for the Chow Parameters Problem which,given (sufficiently accurate approximations to) the Chow parameters of anylinear threshold function $f$, runs in time $\tilde{O}(n^2)\cdot(1/\eps)^{O(\log^2(1/\eps))}$ and with high probability outputs arepresentation of an LTF $f'$ that is $\eps$-close to $f$. The only previousalgorithm (O'Donnell and Servedio) had running time $\poly(n) \cdot2^{2^{\tilde{O}(1/\eps^2)}}.$ As a byproduct of our approach, we show that for any linear thresholdfunction $f$ over $\{-1,1\}^n$, there is a linear threshold function $f'$ whichis $\eps$-close to $f$ and has all weights that are integers at most $\sqrt{n}\cdot (1/\eps)^{O(\log^2(1/\eps))}$. This significantly improves the bestprevious result of Diakonikolas and Servedio which gave a $\poly(n) \cdot2^{\tilde{O}(1/\eps^{2/3})}$ weight bound, and is close to the known lowerbound of $\max\{\sqrt{n},$ $(1/\eps)^{\Omega(\log \log (1/\eps))}\}$ (Goldberg,Servedio). Our techniques also yield improved algorithms for related problemsin learning theory.

Inthis paper, we adopt the position that it is time for morecomputationally-oriented research on problems involving framing. In theinterests of furthering that goal, we propose the following specific,interesting and, we believe, relatively accessible question: In the controversyregarding the use of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture, dopro- and anti-GMO articles differ in whether they choose to adopt a"scientific" tone? Prior work on the rhetoric and sociology of science suggests that hedging maydistinguish popular-science text from text written by professional scientistsfor their colleagues. We propose a detailed approach to studying whether hedgedetection can be used to understanding scientific framing in the GMO debates,and provide corpora to facilitate this study. Some of our preliminary analysessuggest that hedges occur less frequently in scientific discourse than inpopular text, a finding that contradicts prior assertions in the literature. Wehope that our initial work and data will encourage others to pursue thispromising line of inquiry.

Itreconstructs the original signal from the linear sub-Nyquist measurements.Classical methods exploit the sparsity in one domain to formulate the L0 normoptimization. Recent investigation shows that some signals are sparse inmultiple domains. To further improve the signal reconstruction performance, wecan exploit this multi-sparsity to generate a new convex programming model. Thelatter is formulated with multiple sparsity constraints in multiple domains andthe linear measurement fitting constraint. It improves signal recoveryperformance by additional a priori information. Since some EMG signals exhibitsparsity both in time and frequency domains, we take them as example innumerical experiments. Results show that the newly proposed method achievesbetter performance for multi-sparse signals.
arxiv-1206-0730 | Theoretical foundation for CMA-ES from information geometric perspective |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0730  | author:Youhei Akimoto, Yuichi Nagata, Isao Ono, Shigenobu Kobayashi category:cs.NE published:2012-06-04 summary:This paper explores the theoretical basis of the covariance matrix adaptationevolution strategy (CMA-ES) from the information geometry viewpoint. To establish a theoretical foundation for the CMA-ES, we focus on a geometricstructure of a Riemannian manifold of probability distributions equipped withthe Fisher metric. We define a function on the manifold which is theexpectation of fitness over the sampling distribution, and regard the goal ofupdate of the parameters of sampling distribution in the CMA-ES as maximizationof the expected fitness. We investigate the steepest ascent learning for theexpected fitness maximization, where the steepest ascent direction is given bythe natural gradient, which is the product of the inverse of the Fisherinformation matrix and the conventional gradient of the function. Our first result is that we can obtain under some types of parameterizationof multivariate normal distribution the natural gradient of the expectedfitness without the need for inversion of the Fisher information matrix. Wefind that the update of the distribution parameters in the CMA-ES is the sameas natural gradient learning for expected fitness maximization. Our secondresult is that we derive the range of learning rates such that a step in thedirection of the exact natural gradient improves the parameters in the expectedfitness. We see from the close relation between the CMA-ES and natural gradientlearning that the default setting of learning rates in the CMA-ES seemssuitable in terms of monotone improvement in expected fitness. Then, we discussthe relation to the expectation-maximization framework and provide aninformation geometric interpretation of the CMA-ES.

We analyze the corresponding generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)statistics and relate it to the problem of finding a sparsest cut in a graph.We develop a tractable relaxation of the GLR statistic based on thecombinatorial Laplacian of the graph, which we call the spectral scanstatistic, and analyze its properties. We show how its performance as a testingprocedure depends directly on the spectrum of the graph, and use this result toexplicitly derive its asymptotic properties on few significant graphtopologies. Finally, we demonstrate both theoretically and by simulations thatthe spectral scan statistic can outperform naive testing procedures based onedge thresholding and $\chi^2$ testing.

arxiv-1206-0500 | Binary hidden Markov models and varieties |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0500  | author:Andrew J. Critch category:math.AG stat.ML 14Q15 published:2012-06-03 summary:The technological applications of hidden Markov models have been extremelydiverse and successful, including natural language processing, gesturerecognition, gene sequencing, and Kalman filtering of physical measurements.HMMs are highly non-linear statistical models, and just as linear models areamenable to linear algebraic techniques, non-linear models are amenable tocommutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This paper closely examines HMMs in which all the hidden random variables arebinary. Its main contributions are (1) a birational parametrization for everysuch HMM, with an explicit inverse for recovering the hidden parameters interms of observables, (2) a semialgebraic model membership test for every suchHMM, and (3) minimal defining equations for the 4-node fully binary model,comprising 21 quadrics and 29 cubics, which were computed using Grobner basesin the cumulant coordinates of Sturmfels and Zwiernik. The new model parametersin (1) are rationally identifiable in the sense of Sullivant, Garcia-Puente,and Spielvogel, and each model's Zariski closure is therefore a rationalprojective variety of dimension 5. Grobner basis computations for the model andits graph are found to be considerably faster using these parameters. In thecase of two hidden states, item (2) supersedes a previous algorithm ofSchonhuth which is only generically defined, and the defining equations (3)yield new invariants for HMMs of all lengths $\geq 4$. Such invariants havebeen used successfully in model selection problems in phylogenetics, and onecan hope for similar applications in the case of HMMs.

Aconfidence evaluation method for a selected route in the hierarchy is proposedto evaluate the reliability of the final candidate labels in an HTC system. Inorder to take into account the information embedded in the hierarchy, weightfactors are used to take into account the importance of each level. Anacceptance/rejection strategy in the top-down decision making process isproposed, which improves the overall categorization accuracy by rejecting a fewpercentage of samples, i.e., those with low reliability score. Experimentalresults on the Reuters benchmark dataset (RCV1- v2) confirm the effectivenessof the proposed method, compared to other state-of-the art HTC methods.

Montufar, Jason Morton category:stat.ML math.CO G.3 published:2012-06-02 summary:We derive relations between theoretical properties of restricted Boltzmannmachines (RBMs), popular machine learning models which form the building blocksof deep learning models, and several natural notions from discrete mathematicsand convex geometry. We give implications and equivalences relatingRBM-representable probability distributions, perfectly reconstructible inputs,Hamming modes, zonotopes and zonosets, point configurations in hyperplanearrangements, linear threshold codes, and multi-covering numbers of hypercubes.As a motivating application, we prove results on the relative representationalpower of mixtures of product distributions and products of mixtures of pairs ofproduct distributions (RBMs) that formally justify widely held intuitions aboutdistributed representations. In particular, we show that a mixture of productsrequiring an exponentially larger number of parameters is needed to representthe probability distributions which can be obtained as products of mixtures.

Photonlimitations are an important concern for many applications such as spectralimaging, night vision, nuclear medicine, and astronomy. Typically a Poissondistribution is used to model these observations, and the inherentheteroscedasticity of the data combined with standard noise removal methodsyields significant artifacts. This paper introduces a novel denoising algorithmfor photon-limited images which combines elements of dictionary learning andsparse patch-based representations of images. The method employs both anadaptation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Poisson noise and recentlydeveloped sparsity-regularized convex optimization algorithms forphoton-limited images. A comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposedmethod helps characterize the performance of this approach relative to otherstate-of-the-art denoising methods. The results reveal that, despite itsconceptual simplicity, Poisson PCA-based denoising appears to be highlycompetitive in very low light regimes.

Contrary toprevious approaches in this novel field, the presented method does not rely onhighly structured datasets obtained with serious human annotation effort: itonly needs an unstructured and unannotated corpus (i.e., document collection)as input. The method builds upon two additional pillars: (i) a topic model,which induces a topic dictionary from the input corpus (examples include e.g.,latent semantic analysis, group-structured dictionaries or latent Dirichletallocation), and (ii) a semantic similarity measure of word pairs. Our methodcan (i) generate automatically a large number of proper word puzzles ofdifferent types, including the odd one out, choose the related word andseparate the topics puzzle. (ii) It can easily create domain-specific puzzlesby replacing the corpus component. (iii) It is also capable of automaticallygenerating puzzles with parameterizable levels of difficulty suitable for,e.g., beginners or intermediate learners.

Temlyakov category:stat.ML math.OC 41A65 published:2012-06-02 summary:This paper is a follow up to the previous author's paper on convexoptimization. In that paper we began the process of adjusting greedy-typealgorithms from nonlinear approximation for finding sparse solutions of convexoptimization problems. We modified there three the most popular in nonlinearapproximation in Banach spaces greedy algorithms -- Weak Chebyshev GreedyAlgorithm, Weak Greedy Algorithm with Free Relaxation and Weak Relaxed GreedyAlgorithm -- for solving convex optimization problems. We continue to studysparse approximate solutions to convex optimization problems. It is known thatin many engineering applications researchers are interested in an approximatesolution of an optimization problem as a linear combination of elements from agiven system of elements. There is an increasing interest in building suchsparse approximate solutions using different greedy-type algorithms. In thispaper we concentrate on greedy algorithms that provide expansions, which meansthat the approximant at the $m$th iteration is equal to the sum of theapproximant from the previous iteration ($(m-1)$th iteration) and one elementfrom the dictionary with an appropriate coefficient. The problem of greedyexpansions of elements of a Banach space is well studied in nonlinearapproximation theory. At a first glance the setting of a problem of expansionof a given element and the setting of the problem of expansion in anoptimization problem are very different. However, it turns out that the sametechnique can be used for solving both problems. We show how the techniquedeveloped in nonlinear approximation theory, in particular, the greedyexpansions technique can be adjusted for finding a sparse solution of anoptimization problem given by an expansion with respect to a given dictionary.

Ourestimation scheme assumes that each predictive function can be estimated in theform of a linear combination of the basis functions. By assuming that thecoefficient matrix admits a sparse low-rank structure, we formulate thefunction estimation problem as a convex program regularized by the trace normand the $\ell_1$-norm simultaneously. We propose to solve the convex programusing the accelerated gradient (AG) method and the alternating direction methodof multipliers (ADMM) respectively; we also develop efficient algorithms tosolve the key components in both AG and ADMM. In addition, we conducttheoretical analysis on the proposed function estimation scheme: we derive akey property of the optimal solution to the convex program; based on anassumption on the basis functions, we establish a performance bound of theproposed function estimation scheme (via the composite regularization).Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposedalgorithms.

The latterresult suggests a duality between the PIR and the multi-information rate forprocesses with mutually inverse power spectra (i.e. with poles and zeros of thetransfer function exchanged). We investigate the behaviour of the PIR inrelation to the multi-information rate for some simple examples, which suggest,somewhat counter-intuitively, that the PIR is maximised for very `smooth' ARprocesses whose power spectra have multiple poles at zero frequency. We alsoobtain results for moving average Gaussian processes which are consistent withthe duality conjectured earlier. One consequence of this is that the PIR isunbounded for MA(N) processes.

Kappes category:cs.AI cs.MS stat.ML published:2012-06-01 summary:OpenGM is a C++ template library for defining discrete graphical models andperforming inference on these models, using a wide range of state-of-the-artalgorithms. No restrictions are imposed on the factor graph to allow forhigher-order factors and arbitrary neighborhood structures. Large models withrepetitive structure are handled efficiently because (i) functions that occurrepeatedly need to be stored only once, and (ii) distinct functions can beimplemented differently, using different encodings alongside each other in thesame model. Several parametric functions (e.g. metrics), sparse and dense valuetables are provided and so is an interface for custom C++ code. Algorithms areseparated by design from the representation of graphical models and are easilyexchangeable. OpenGM, its algorithms, HDF5 file format and command line toolsare modular and extendible.

Weuse frequency distributions and differences between them to define anddistinguish languages. English and French texts were analyzed to determine adifference threshold of 55 before the texts are considered to be in differentlanguages, and this threshold was verified using Spanish texts. The secondportion of our system focuses on gaining an understanding of the syntax of alanguage using a recursive method. The program uses one of two possible methodsto analyze given sentences based on either sentence patterns or surroundingwords. Both methods have been implemented in C++. The program is able tounderstand the structure of simple sentences and learn new words. In addition,we have provided some suggestions regarding future work and potentialextensions of the existing program.

However, it predicts a Poisson degreedistribution within each community, while most real-world networks have aheavy-tailed degree distribution. The degree-corrected block model canaccommodate arbitrary degree distributions within communities. But since ittakes the vertex degrees as parameters rather than generating them, it cannotuse them to help it classify the vertices, and its natural generalization todirected graphs cannot even use the orientations of the edges. In this paper,we present variants of the block model with the best of both worlds: they canuse vertex degrees and edge orientations in the classification process, whiletolerating heavy-tailed degree distributions within communities. We show thatfor some networks, including synthetic networks and networks of wordadjacencies in English text, these new block models achieve a higher accuracythan either standard or degree-corrected block models.

In this paper, we propose an algorithmthat outperforms BPDN in finding sparse solutions to underdetermined linearsystems of equations at no additional computational cost. Our algorithm, calledWSPGL1, is a modification of the spectral projected gradient for $\ell_1$minimization (SPGL1) algorithm in which the sequence of LASSO subproblems arereplaced by a sequence of weighted LASSO subproblems with constant weightsapplied to a support estimate. The support estimate is derived from the dataand is updated at every iteration. The algorithm also modifies the Pareto curveat every iteration to reflect the new weighted $\ell_1$ minimization problemthat is being solved. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that thesparse recovery performance of our algorithm is superior to that of $\ell_1$minimization and approaches the recovery performance of iterative re-weighted$\ell_1$ (IRWL1) minimization of Cand{\`e}s, Wakin, and Boyd, although it doesnot match it in general. Moreover, our algorithm has the computational cost ofa single BPDN problem.

Howard category:cs.SI cs.IT cs.LG math.IT published:2012-05-30 summary:We study a social network consisting of agents organized as a hierarchicalM-ary rooted tree, common in enterprise and military organizational structures.The goal is to aggregate information to solve a binary hypothesis testingproblem. Each agent at a leaf of the tree, and only such an agent, makes adirect measurement of the underlying true hypothesis. The leaf agent then makesa decision and sends it to its supervising agent, at the next level of thetree. Each supervising agent aggregates the decisions from the M members of itsgroup, produces a summary message, and sends it to its supervisor at the nextlevel, and so on. Ultimately, the agent at the root of the tree makes anoverall decision. We derive upper and lower bounds for the Type I and II errorprobabilities associated with this decision with respect to the number of leafagents, which in turn characterize the converge rates of the Type I, Type II,and total error probabilities. We also provide a message-passing schemeinvolving non-binary message alphabets and characterize the exponent of theerror probability with respect to the message alphabet size.

In the meanwhile, tostrengthen the search ability in high dimensional space, communication strategyis introduced into the basic algorithm and intermittent exchange is presentedto prevent premature convergence. Finally, experiments are carried out for thealgorithms. With 10 common benchmark unconstrained continuous functions used totest the performance, the results show that state transition algorithms arepromising algorithms due to their good global search capability and convergenceproperty when compared with some popular algorithms.

Theclassification is achieved by extracting the energy computed from all thesub-bands of DWT combined with the spatial features of non-zero singular valuesobtained from the SVD of fingerprint images. K nearest neighbor (KNN) used as aclassifier. This method is experimented with the internal database of 3570fingerprints finger prints in which 1980 were male fingerprints and 1590 werefemale fingerprints. Finger-wise gender classification is achieved which is94.32% for the left hand little fingers of female persons and 95.46% for theleft hand index finger of male persons. Gender classification for any finger ofmale persons tested is attained as 91.67% and 84.69% for female personsrespectively. Overall classification rate is 88.28% has been achieved.
arxiv-1205-6605 | Template-Cut: A Pattern-Based Segmentation Paradigm |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6605  | author:Jan Egger, Bernd Freisleben, Christopher Nimsky, Tina Kapur category:cs.CV published:2012-05-30 summary:We present a scale-invariant, template-based segmentation paradigm that setsup a graph and performs a graph cut to separate an object from the background.Typically graph-based schemes distribute the nodes of the graph uniformly andequidistantly on the image, and use a regularizer to bias the cut towards aparticular shape. The strategy of uniform and equidistant nodes does not allowthe cut to prefer more complex structures, especially when areas of the objectare indistinguishable from the background. We propose a solution by introducingthe concept of a "template shape" of the target object in which the nodes aresampled non-uniformly and non-equidistantly on the image. We evaluate it on2D-images where the object's textures and backgrounds are similar, and largeareas of the object have the same gray level appearance as the background. Wealso evaluate it in 3D on 60 brain tumor datasets for neurosurgical planningpurposes.

The proposed method mainly consists ofspatial unsupervised grayscale image segmentation that divides an image intoregions. The aim of this algorithm is to produce precise segmentation of imagesusing intensity information along with neighborhood relationships. In thispaper, Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Network (FHNN) clustering helps in generating thepopulation of Genetic algorithm which there by automatically segments theimage. This technique is a powerful method for image segmentation and works forboth single and multiple-feature data with spatial information. Validity indexhas been utilized for introducing a robust technique for finding the optimumnumber of components in an image. Experimental results shown that the algorithmgenerates good quality segmented image.

These tools have applications in a plethora of settings,including data analysis in the fields of business, education, forensics, andbiology (such as microarray, proteomics, brain imaging), to name a few. In the present work, we focus our investigation on the limitations andpotential misuses of certain tools in the analysis of the benchmark coloncancer data (2,000 variables; Alon et al., 1999) and the prostate cancer data(6,033 variables; Efron, 2010, 2008). Our analysis demonstrates that modelsthat produce 100% accuracy measures often select different sets of genes andcannot stand the scrutiny of parameter estimates and model stability. Furthermore, we created a host of simulation datasets and "artificialdiseases" to evaluate the reliability of commonly used statistical and datamining tools. We found that certain widely used models can classify the datawith 100% accuracy without using any of the variables responsible for thedisease. With moderate sample size and suitable pre-screening, stochasticgradient boosting will be shown to be a superior model for gene selection andvariable screening from high-dimensional datasets.

Williams, Iain Murray category:stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO published:2012-05-29 summary:Gaussian process (GP) predictors are an important component of many Bayesianapproaches to machine learning. However, even a straightforward implementationof Gaussian process regression (GPR) requires O(n^2) space and O(n^3) time fora dataset of n examples. Several approximation methods have been proposed, butthere is a lack of understanding of the relative merits of the differentapproximations, and in what situations they are most useful. We recommendassessing the quality of the predictions obtained as a function of the computetime taken, and comparing to standard baselines (e.g., Subset of Data andFITC). We empirically investigate four different approximation algorithms onfour different prediction problems, and make our code available to encouragefuture comparisons.

In the first four methods, the classification is based on areduction to binary classification. We consider the case where the binaryclassifier comes from a class of VC dimension $d$, and in particular from theclass of halfspaces over $\reals^d$. We analyze both the estimation error andthe approximation error of these methods. Our analysis reveals interestingconclusions of practical relevance, regarding the success of the differentapproaches under various conditions. Our proof technique employs tools from VCtheory to analyze the \emph{approximation error} of hypothesis classes. This isin sharp contrast to most, if not all, previous uses of VC theory, which onlydeal with estimation error.
arxiv-1205-6396 | Effective Listings of Function Stop words for Twitter |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6396  | author:Murphy Choy category:cs.IR cs.CL published:2012-05-29 summary:Many words in documents recur very frequently but are essentially meaninglessas they are used to join words together in a sentence. It is commonlyunderstood that stop words do not contribute to the context or content oftextual documents. Due to their high frequency of occurrence, their presence intext mining presents an obstacle to the understanding of the content in thedocuments. To eliminate the bias effects, most text mining software orapproaches make use of stop words list to identify and remove those words.However, the development of such top words list is difficult and inconsistentbetween textual sources. This problem is further aggravated by sources such asTwitter which are highly repetitive or similar in nature. In this paper, wewill be examining the original work using term frequency, inverse documentfrequency and term adjacency for developing a stop words list for the Twitterdata source. We propose a new technique using combinatorial values as analternative measure to effectively list out stop words.

This generalizes the monotonic chains in [9] in anatural way. We also show how to deal with nested factors in an efficient way.Experiments show an improvement over min-sum diffusion, MPLP and subgradientascent algorithms on a number of computer vision and natural languageprocessing problems.

To measure the similarities of these chains, a kernel on strings isdefined using only the sequence of the chains and a good amino acidsubstitution matrix (e.g. BLOSUM62). The kernel is used in learning machines topredict binding affinities of peptides to human leukocyte antigens DR (HLA-DR)molecules. On both fixed allele (Nielsen and Lund 2009) and pan-allele (Nielsenet.al. 2010) benchmark databases, our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-artperformance. The kernel is also used to define a distance on an HLA-DR alleleset based on which a clustering analysis precisely recovers the serotypeclassifications assigned by WHO (Nielsen and Lund 2009, and Marsh et.al. 2010).These results suggest that our kernel relates well the chain structure of bothpeptides and HLA-DR molecules to their biological functions, and that it offersa simple, powerful and promising methodology to immunology and amino acid chainstudies.
arxiv-1205-6210 | Learning Dictionaries with Bounded Self-Coherence |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6210  | author:Christian D. Sigg, Tomas Dikk, Joachim M. Buhmann category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2012-05-28 summary:Sparse coding in learned dictionaries has been established as a successfulapproach for signal denoising, source separation and solving inverse problemsin general. A dictionary learning method adapts an initial dictionary to aparticular signal class by iteratively computing an approximate factorizationof a training data matrix into a dictionary and a sparse coding matrix. Thelearned dictionary is characterized by two properties: the coherence of thedictionary to observations of the signal class, and the self-coherence of thedictionary atoms. A high coherence to the signal class enables the sparsecoding of signal observations with a small approximation error, while a lowself-coherence of the atoms guarantees atom recovery and a more rapid residualerror decay rate for the sparse coding algorithm. The two goals of high signalcoherence and low self-coherence are typically in conflict, therefore one seeksa trade-off between them, depending on the application. We present a dictionarylearning method with an effective control over the self-coherence of thetrained dictionary, enabling a trade-off between maximizing the sparsity ofcodings and approximating an equiangular tight frame.
arxiv-1205-5868 | Sparse estimation via nonconcave penalized likelihood in a factor analysis model |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5868  | author:Kei Hirose, Michio Yamamoto category:stat.ME stat.CO stat.ML published:2012-05-26 summary:We consider the problem of sparse estimation in a factor analysis model. Atraditional estimation procedure in use is the following two-step approach: themodel is estimated by maximum likelihood method and then a rotation techniqueis utilized to find sparse factor loadings. However, the maximum likelihoodestimates cannot be obtained when the number of variables is much larger thanthe number of observations. Furthermore, even if the maximum likelihoodestimates are available, the rotation technique does not often produce asufficiently sparse solution. In order to handle these problems, this paperintroduces a penalized likelihood procedure that imposes a nonconvex penalty onthe factor loadings. We show that the penalized likelihood procedure can beviewed as a generalization of the traditional two-step approach, and theproposed methodology can produce sparser solutions than the rotation technique.A new algorithm via the EM algorithm along with coordinate descent isintroduced to compute the entire solution path, which permits the applicationto a wide variety of convex and nonconvex penalties. Monte Carlo simulationsare conducted to investigate the performance of our modeling strategy. A realdata example is also given to illustrate our procedure.
arxiv-1205-5920 | On latent position inference from doubly stochastic messaging activities |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5920  | author:Nam H. Lee, Jordan Yoder, Minh Tang, Carey E Priebe category:stat.ML math.ST stat.ME stat.TH published:2012-05-26 summary:We model messaging activities as a hierarchical doubly stochastic pointprocess with three main levels, and develop an iterative algorithm forinferring actors' relative latent positions from a stream of messaging activitydata. Each of the message-exchanging actors is modeled as a process in a latentspace. The actors' latent positions are assumed to be influenced by thedistribution of a much larger population over the latent space. Each actor'smovement in the latent space is modeled as being governed by two parametersthat we call confidence and visibility, in addition to dependence on thepopulation distribution. The messaging frequency between a pair of actors isassumed to be inversely proportional to the distance between their latentpositions. Our inference algorithm is based on a projection approach to anonline filtering problem. The algorithm associates each actor with aprobability density-valued process, and each probability density is assumed tobe a mixture of basis functions. For efficient numerical experiments, wefurther develop our algorithm for the case where the basis functions areobtained by translating and scaling a standard Gaussian density.

In the compactness theorem, measurabilityof the hypotheses of the created sample compression scheme is not guaranteed;at the same time measurability of the hypotheses is a necessary condition forlearnability. In this thesis we discuss when a sample compression scheme,created from com- pression schemes on finite subspaces via the compactnesstheorem, have measurable hypotheses. We show that if X is a standard Borelspace with a d-maximum and universally separable concept class C, then (X,C)has a sample compression scheme of size d with universally Borel measurablehypotheses. Additionally we introduce a new variant of compression schemecalled a copy sample compression scheme.

We studysimilarity in image registration in the context of Locally Orderless Images(LOI), which is the natural way to study density estimates and reveals the 3fundamental scales: the measurement scale, the intensity scale, and theintegration scale. This paper has three main contributions: Firstly, we rephrase a large set ofpopular similarity measures into a common framework, which we refer to asLocally Orderless Registration, and which makes full use of the features oflocal histograms. Secondly, we extend the theoretical understanding of thelocal histograms. Thirdly, we use our framework to compare two state-of-the-artintensity density estimators for image registration: The Parzen Window (PW) andthe Generalized Partial Volume (GPV), and we demonstrate their differences on apopular similarity measure, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). We conclude, that complicated similarity measures such as NMI may beevaluated almost as fast as simple measures such as Sum of Squared Distances(SSD) regardless of the choice of PW and GPV. Also, GPV is an asymmetricmeasure, and PW is our preferred choice.

Thegoal of this paper is to provide a learning method to compute the most likelyrelationship between two nodes in a framework based on probabilistic graphs. Inparticular, given a probabilistic graph we adopted the language-constraintreachability method to compute the probability of possible interconnectionsthat may exists between two nodes. Each of these connections may be viewed asfeature, or a factor, between the two nodes and the corresponding probabilityas its weight. Each observed link is considered as a positive instance for itscorresponding link label. Given the training set of observed links aL2-regularized Logistic Regression has been adopted to learn a model able topredict unobserved link labels. The experiments on a real world collaborativefiltering problem proved that the proposed approach achieves better resultsthan that obtained adopting classical methods.

The existingalgorithm for solving TILT is based on the alternating direction method (ADM).It suffers from high computational cost and is not theoretically guaranteed toconverge to a correct solution. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm tospeed up solving TILT, with guaranteed convergence. Our method is based on therecently proposed linearized alternating direction method with adaptive penalty(LADMAP). To further reduce computation, warm starts are also introduced toinitialize the variables better and cut the cost on singular valuedecomposition. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datademonstrate that this new algorithm works much more efficiently and robustlythan the existing algorithm. It could be at least five times faster than theprevious method.

While promising, most of the existing works use convexmethods, which may be suboptimal in terms of the accuracy of feature selectionand parameter estimation. In this paper, we expand a nonconvex paradigm tosparse group feature selection, which is motivated by applications that requireidentifying the underlying group structure and performing feature selectionsimultaneously. The main contributions of this article are twofold: (1)statistically, we introduce a nonconvex sparse group feature selection modelwhich can reconstruct the oracle estimator. Therefore, consistent featureselection and parameter estimation can be achieved; (2) computationally, wepropose an efficient algorithm that is applicable to large-scale problems.Numerical results suggest that the proposed nonconvex method compares favorablyagainst its competitors on synthetic data and real-world applications, thusachieving desired goal of delivering high performance.
arxiv-1205-4891 | Clustering is difficult only when it does not matter |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4891  | author:Amit Daniely, Nati Linial, Michael Saks category:cs.LG cs.DS published:2012-05-22 summary:Numerous papers ask how difficult it is to cluster data. We suggest that themore relevant and interesting question is how difficult it is to cluster datasets {\em that can be clustered well}. More generally, despite the ubiquity andthe great importance of clustering, we still do not have a satisfactorymathematical theory of clustering. In order to properly understand clustering,it is clearly necessary to develop a solid theoretical basis for the area. Forexample, from the perspective of computational complexity theory the clusteringproblem seems very hard. Numerous papers introduce various criteria andnumerical measures to quantify the quality of a given clustering. The resultingconclusions are pessimistic, since it is computationally difficult to find anoptimal clustering of a given data set, if we go by any of these popularcriteria. In contrast, the practitioners' perspective is much more optimistic.Our explanation for this disparity of opinions is that complexity theoryconcentrates on the worst case, whereas in reality we only care for data setsthat can be clustered well. We introduce a theoretical framework of clustering in metric spaces thatrevolves around a notion of "good clustering". We show that if a goodclustering exists, then in many cases it can be efficiently found. Ourconclusion is that contrary to popular belief, clustering should not beconsidered a hard task.

These methods generallyconcentrate on the interpretability of the visualization and pay littleattention to the interpretability of the projection axes. In this paper, weargue that interpretability of the visualizations and the featuretransformation functions are both crucial for visual exploration of highdimensional labeled data. We present a two-part user study to examine these tworelated but orthogonal aspects of interpretability. We first study how humansjudge the quality of 2D scatterplots of various datasets with varying number ofclasses and provide comparisons with ten automated measures, including a numberof visual quality measures and related measures from various machine learningfields. We then investigate how the user perception on interpretability ofmathematical expressions relate to various automated measures of complexitythat can be used to characterize data projection functions. We conclude with adiscussion of how automated measures of visual and semantic interpretability ofdata projections can be used together for exploratory analysis inclassification tasks.
arxiv-1205-4810 | Safe Exploration in Markov Decision Processes |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4810  | author:Teodor Mihai Moldovan, Pieter Abbeel category:cs.LG published:2012-05-22 summary:In environments with uncertain dynamics exploration is necessary to learn howto perform well. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strongexploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. Theessence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any otherstate by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for explorationalgorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visitedbefore. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systemswould break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., mostphysical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper weaddress the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. Wefirst propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show thatimposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteedsafe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteedsafe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimizationformulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of theguaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Ourframework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed explorationmethods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include aMartian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explorebetter than classical exploration methods.

We givea precise characterization of the effect of this hierarchy constraint, provethat hierarchy holds with probability one and derive an unbiased estimate forthe degrees of freedom of our estimator. A bound on this estimate reveals theamount of fitting "saved" by the hierarchy constraint. We distinguish betweenparameter sparsity - the number of nonzero coefficients - and practicalsparsity - the number of raw variables one must measure to make a newprediction. Hierarchy focuses on the latter, which is more closely tied toimportant data collection concerns such as cost, time and effort. We develop analgorithm, available in the R package hierNet, and perform an empirical studyof our method.

This approach has many advantages and hasled to a deep and beautiful theory. However, from the practical perspective,this leaves much to be desired. In application areas, practically interestinginstances very often occupy just a tiny part of an algorithm's space ofinstances, and the vast majority of instances are simply irrelevant. Addressingthese issues is a major challenge for theoretical computer science which maymake theory more relevant to the practice of computer science. Following Bilu and Linial, we apply this perspective to MAXCUT, viewed as aclustering problem. Using a variety of techniques, we investigate practicallyinteresting instances of this problem. Specifically, we show how to solve inpolynomial time distinguished, metric, expanding and dense instances of MAXCUTunder mild stability assumptions. In particular, $(1+\epsilon)$-stability(which is optimal) suffices for metric and dense MAXCUT. We also show how tosolve in polynomial time $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-stable instances of MAXCUT,substantially improving the best previously known result.

Unnikrishnan, Kannan Balakrishnan category:cs.CV published:2012-05-22 summary:Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) are one of the earliest techniquesused for image texture analysis. In this paper we defined a new feature calledtrace extracted from the GLCM and its implications in texture analysis arediscussed in the context of Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR).

arxiv-1205-4839 | Off-Policy Actor-Critic |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4839  | author:Thomas Degris, Martha White, Richard S. Sutton category:cs.LG published:2012-05-22 summary:This paper presents the first actor-critic algorithm for off-policyreinforcement learning. Our algorithm is online and incremental, and itsper-time-step complexity scales linearly with the number of learned weights.Previous work on actor-critic algorithms is limited to the on-policy settingand does not take advantage of the recent advances in off-policy gradienttemporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enablea target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another(behavior) policy. For many problems, however, actor-critic methods are morepractical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitlyrepresent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize alarge action space. In this paper, we illustrate how to practically combine thegenerality and learning potential of off-policy learning with the flexibilityin action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental,linear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces,prove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms,and empirically show better or comparable performance to existing algorithms onstandard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems.
arxiv-1205-4698 | The Role of Weight Shrinking in Large Margin Perceptron Learning |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4698  | author:Constantinos Panagiotakopoulos, Petroula Tsampouka category:cs.LG published:2012-05-21 summary:We introduce into the classical perceptron algorithm with margin a mechanismthat shrinks the current weight vector as a first step of the update. If theshrinking factor is constant the resulting algorithm may be regarded as amargin-error-driven version of NORMA with constant learning rate. In this casewe show that the allowed strength of shrinking depends on the value of themaximum margin. We also consider variable shrinking factors for which there isno such dependence. In both cases we obtain new generalizations of theperceptron with margin able to provably attain in a finite number of steps anydesirable approximation of the maximal margin hyperplane. The new approximatemaximum margin classifiers appear experimentally to be very competitive in2-norm soft margin tasks involving linear kernels.

arxiv-1205-4477 | Streaming Algorithms for Pattern Discovery over Dynamically Changing Event Sequences |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4477  | author:Debprakash Patnaik, Naren Ramakrishnan, Srivatsan Laxman, Badrish Chandramouli category:cs.LG cs.DB published:2012-05-21 summary:Discovering frequent episodes over event sequences is an important datamining task. In many applications, events constituting the data sequence arriveas a stream, at furious rates, and recent trends (or frequent episodes) canchange and drift due to the dynamical nature of the underlying event generationprocess. The ability to detect and track such the changing sets of frequentepisodes can be valuable in many application scenarios. Current methods forfrequent episode discovery are typically multipass algorithms, making themunsuitable in the streaming context. In this paper, we propose a new streamingalgorithm for discovering frequent episodes over a window of recent events inthe stream. Our algorithm processes events as they arrive, one batch at a time,while discovering the top frequent episodes over a window consisting of severalbatches in the immediate past. We derive approximation guarantees for ouralgorithm under the condition that frequent episodes are approximatelywell-separated from infrequent ones in every batch of the window. We presentextensive experimental evaluations of our algorithm on both real and syntheticdata. We also present comparisons with baselines and adaptations of streamingalgorithms from itemset mining literature.

Thisconnection introduces a natural regularized loss function which the RKHSembeddings minimise, providing an intuitive understanding of the embeddings anda justification for their use. Furthermore, the equivalence allows theapplication of vector-valued regression methods and results to the problem oflearning conditional distributions. Using this link we derive a sparse versionof the embedding by considering alternative formulations. Further, by applyingconvergence results for vector-valued regression to the embedding problem wederive minimax convergence rates which are O(\log(n)/n) -- compared to currentstate of the art rates of O(n^{-1/4}) -- and are valid under milder and moreintuitive assumptions. These minimax upper rates coincide with lower rates upto a logarithmic factor, showing that the embedding method achieves nearlyoptimal rates. We study our sparse embedding algorithm in a reinforcementlearning task where the algorithm shows significant improvement in sparsityover an incomplete Cholesky decomposition.

arxiv-1206-4880 | Dynamic Domain Classification for Fractal Image Compression |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4880  | author:K. Revathy, M. Jayamohan category:cs.CV cs.GR published:2012-05-20 summary:Fractal image compression is attractive except for its high encoding timerequirements. The image is encoded as a set of contractive affinetransformations. The image is partitioned into non-overlapping range blocks,and a best matching domain block larger than the range block is identified.There are many attempts on improving the encoding time by reducing the size ofsearch pool for range-domain matching. But these methods are attempting toprepare a static domain pool that remains unchanged throughout the encodingprocess. This paper proposes dynamic preparation of separate domain pool foreach range block. This will result in significant reduction in the encodingtime. The domain pool for a particular range block can be selected based upon aparametric value. Here we use classification based on local fractal dimension.

It is often {\it unnecessary} to use every modality to classify amajority of examples. We study a multi-stage system in a prediction time costreduction setting, where the full data is available for training, but for atest example, measurements in a new modality can be acquired at each stage foran additional cost. We seek decision rules to reduce the average measurementacquisition cost. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem (ERM) fora multi-stage reject classifier, wherein the stage $k$ classifier eitherclassifies a sample using only the measurements acquired so far or rejects itto the next stage where more attributes can be acquired for a cost. To solvethe ERM problem, we show that the optimal reject classifier at each stage is acombination of two binary classifiers, one biased towards positive examples andthe other biased towards negative examples. We use this parameterization toconstruct stage-by-stage global surrogate risk, develop an iterative algorithmin the boosting framework and present convergence and generalization results.We test our work on synthetic, medical and explosives detection datasets. Ourresults demonstrate that substantial cost reduction without a significantsacrifice in accuracy is achievable.

We use the precision-biased parsing task to solve the relatedhigh-quality parse-selection task: finding a subset of high-quality (accurate)trees in a large collection of parsed text. We present a method for choosingover a third of the input trees while keeping unlabeled dependency parsingaccuracy of 97% on these trees. We also present a method which is not based onan ensemble but rather on directly predicting the risk associated withindividual parser decisions. In addition to its efficiency, this methoddemonstrates that a parsing system can provide reasonable estimates ofconfidence in its predictions without relying on ensembles or aggregate corpuscounts.

We provelearning bounds based on the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis set andthe discrepancy of distributions both for a drifting PAC scenario and atracking scenario. Our bounds are always tighter and in some casessubstantially improve upon previous ones based on the $L_1$ distance. We alsopresent a generalization of the standard on-line to batch conversion to thedrifting scenario in terms of the discrepancy and arbitrary convex combinationsof hypotheses.

We propose anew type of clustering criteria, specific to the task of part-of-speechtagging. Instead of distributional similarity, these clusters are based on thebeha vior of a baseline tagger when applied to a large corpus. These clusterfeatures provide similar gains in accuracy to those achieved bydistributional-similarity derived clusters. Using both types of clusterfeatures together further improve tagging accuracies. We show that the methodis effective for both the in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios for English,and for French, German and Italian. The effect is larger for out-of-domaintext.

Oncologists are miserably failed inidentifying the micro calcification at the early stage with the help of themammogram visually. In order to improve the performance of the breast cancerscreening, most of the researchers have proposed Computer Aided Diagnosis usingimage processing. In this study mammograms are preprocessed and features areextracted, then the abnormality is identified through the classification. Ifall the extracted features are used, most of the cases are misidentified. Hencefeature selection procedure is sought. In this paper, Fuzzy-Rough featureselection with {\pi} membership function is proposed. The selected features areused to classify the abnormalities with help of Ant-Miner and Weka tools. Theexperimental analysis shows that the proposed method improves the mammogramsclassification accuracy.

Here we applystatistical mechanical tools to analyse the networks underlying three iconicmythological narratives with a view to identifying common and distinguishingquantitative features. Of the three narratives, an Anglo-Saxon and a Greek textare mostly believed by antiquarians to be partly historically based while thethird, an Irish epic, is often considered to be fictional. Here we show thatnetwork analysis is able to discriminate real from imaginary social networksand place mythological narratives on the spectrum between them. Moreover, theperceived artificiality of the Irish narrative can be traced back to anomalousfeatures associated with six characters. Considering these as amalgams ofseveral entities or proxies, renders the plausibility of the Irish textcomparable to the others from a network-theoretic point of view.

At each step, the system (e.g. search engine)receives a context (e.g. query) and predicts an object (e.g. ranking). The userresponds by correcting the system if necessary, providing a slightly improved-- but not necessarily optimal -- object as feedback. We argue that suchfeedback can often be inferred from observable user behavior, for example, fromclicks in web-search. Evaluating predictions by their cardinal utility to theuser, we propose efficient learning algorithms that have ${\calO}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ average regret, even though the learning algorithmnever observes cardinal utility values as in conventional online learning. Wedemonstrate the applicability of our model and learning algorithms on a movierecommendation task, as well as ranking for web-search.

Adaptive networks consist of acollection of agents with processing and learning abilities. The agents arelinked together through a connection topology, and they cooperate with eachother through local interactions to solve distributed optimization, estimation,and inference problems in real-time. The continuous diffusion of informationacross the network enables agents to adapt their performance in relation tostreaming data and network conditions; it also results in improved adaptationand learning performance relative to non-cooperative agents.

Davies category:math.NA cs.LG published:2012-05-18 summary:We consider the problem of learning a low-dimensional signal model from acollection of training samples. The mainstream approach would be to learn anovercomplete dictionary to provide good approximations of the training samplesusing sparse synthesis coefficients. This famous sparse model has a less wellknown counterpart, in analysis form, called the cosparse analysis model. Inthis new model, signals are characterised by their parsimony in a transformeddomain using an overcomplete (linear) analysis operator. We propose to learn ananalysis operator from a training corpus using a constrained optimisationframework based on L1 optimisation. The reason for introducing a constraint inthe optimisation framework is to exclude trivial solutions. Although there isno final answer here for which constraint is the most relevant constraint, weinvestigate some conventional constraints in the model adaptation field and usethe uniformly normalised tight frame (UNTF) for this purpose. We then derive apractical learning algorithm, based on projected subgradients andDouglas-Rachford splitting technique, and demonstrate its ability to robustlyrecover a ground truth analysis operator, when provided with a clean trainingset, of sufficient size. We also find an analysis operator for images, usingsome noisy cosparse signals, which is indeed a more realistic experiment. Asthe derived optimisation problem is not a convex program, we often find a localminimum using such variational methods. Some local optimality conditions arederived for two different settings, providing preliminary theoretical supportfor the well-posedness of the learning problem under appropriate conditions.

It will be more effective to detect impulse noisewhen the impulse is mixed with Gaussian noise.

Braun category:stat.ML cs.AI cs.GT cs.SY published:2012-05-17 summary:The free energy functional has recently been proposed as a variationalprinciple for bounded rational decision-making, since it instantiates a naturaltrade-off between utility gains and information processing costs that can beaxiomatically derived. Here we apply the free energy principle to generaldecision trees that include both adversarial and stochastic environments. Wederive generalized sequential optimality equations that not only include theBellman optimality equations as a limit case, but also lead to well-knowndecision-rules such as Expectimax, Minimax and Expectiminimax. We show howthese decision-rules can be derived from a single free energy principle thatassigns a resource parameter to each node in the decision tree. These resourceparameters express a concrete computational cost that can be measured as theamount of samples that are needed from the distribution that belongs to eachnode. The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis forgeneralized optimality equations that account for both adversarial andstochastic environments.
arxiv-1205-3981 | kLog: A Language for Logical and Relational Learning with Kernels |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3981  | author:Paolo Frasconi, Fabrizio Costa, Luc De Raedt, Kurt De Grave category:cs.AI cs.LG cs.PL published:2012-05-17 summary:We introduce kLog, a novel approach to statistical relational learning.Unlike standard approaches, kLog does not represent a probability distributiondirectly. It is rather a language to perform kernel-based learning onexpressive logical and relational representations. kLog allows users to specifylearning problems declaratively. It builds on simple but powerful concepts:learning from interpretations, entity/relationship data modeling, logicprogramming, and deductive databases. Access by the kernel to the richrepresentation is mediated by a technique we call graphicalization: therelational representation is first transformed into a graph --- in particular,a grounded entity/relationship diagram. Subsequently, a choice of graph kerneldefines the feature space. kLog supports mixed numerical and symbolic data, aswell as background knowledge in the form of Prolog or Datalog programs as ininductive logic programming systems. The kLog framework can be applied totackle the same range of tasks that has made statistical relational learning sopopular, including classification, regression, multitask learning, andcollective classification. We also report about empirical comparisons, showingthat kLog can be either more accurate, or much faster at the same level ofaccuracy, than Tilde and Alchemy. kLog is GPLv3 licensed and is available athttp://klog.dinfo.unifi.it along with tutorials.

In this learning process, a trader rationally chooses his gamblesusing predictions made by a randomized well-calibrated algorithm. Our strategyis based on Dawid's notion of calibration with more general checking rules andon some modification of Kakade and Foster's randomized rounding algorithm forcomputing the well-calibrated forecasts. We combine the method of randomizedcalibration with Vovk's method of defensive forecasting in RKHS. Unlike thestatistical theory, no stochastic assumptions are made about the stock prices.Our empirical results on historical markets provide strong evidence that thistype of technical trading can "beat the market" if transaction costs areignored.

There is a problem that the normalization term ofthe NML code-length may diverge when it is continuous and unbounded and astraightforward computation of it is highly expensive when the data domain isfinite . In previous works it has been investigated how to calculate the NMLcode-length for specific types of distributions. We first propose a generalmethod for computing the NML code-length for the exponential family. Then wespecifically focus on Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and propose a new efficientmethod for computing the NML to them. We develop it by generalizing Rissanen'sre-normalizing technique. Then we apply this method to the clustering issue, inwhich a clustering structure is modeled using a GMM, and the main task is toestimate the optimal number of clusters on the basis of the NML code-length. Wedemonstrate using artificial data sets the superiority of the NML-basedclustering over other criteria such as AIC, BIC in terms of the data sizerequired for high accuracy rate to be achieved.

Gutiérrez-Peña, C. Hervás-Martínez category:cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV published:2012-05-15 summary:This paper deals with the distributed processing in the search for an optimumclassification model using evolutionary product unit neural networks. For thisdistributed search we used a cluster of computers. Our objective is to obtain amore efficient design than those net architectures which do not use adistributed process and which thus result in simpler designs. In order to getthe best classification models we use evolutionary algorithms to train anddesign neural networks, which require a very time consuming computation. Thereasons behind the need for this distribution are various. It is complicated totrain this type of nets because of the difficulty entailed in determining theirarchitecture due to the complex error surface. On the other hand, the use ofevolutionary algorithms involves running a great number of tests with differentseeds and parameters, thus resulting in a high computational cost
arxiv-1205-3234 | Asymptotic Accuracy of Bayes Estimation for Latent Variables with Redundancy |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3234  | author:Keisuke Yamazaki category:stat.ML published:2012-05-15 summary:Hierarchical parametric models consisting of observable and latent variablesare widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. For example, a mixture modelis a representative hierarchical model for clustering. From the statisticalpoint of view, the models can be regular or singular due to the distribution ofdata. In the regular case, the models have the identifiability; there isone-to-one relation between a probability density function for the modelexpression and the parameter. The Fisher information matrix is positivedefinite, and the estimation accuracy of both observable and latent variableshas been studied. In the singular case, on the other hand, the models are notidentifiable and the Fisher matrix is not positive definite. Conventionalstatistical analysis based on the inverse Fisher matrix is not applicable.Recently, an algebraic geometrical analysis has been developed and is used toelucidate the Bayes estimation of observable variables. The present paperapplies this analysis to latent-variable estimation and determines itstheoretical performance. Our results clarify behavior of the convergence of theposterior distribution. It is found that the posterior of theobservable-variable estimation can be different from the one in thelatent-variable estimation. Because of the difference, the Markov chain MonteCarlo method based on the parameter and the latent variable cannot constructthe desired posterior distribution.
arxiv-1205-3137 | Unsupervised Discovery of Mid-Level Discriminative Patches |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3137  | author:Saurabh Singh, Abhinav Gupta, Alexei A. Efros category:cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG published:2012-05-14 summary:The goal of this paper is to discover a set of discriminative patches whichcan serve as a fully unsupervised mid-level visual representation. The desiredpatches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need tooccur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they needto be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches couldcorrespond to parts, objects, "visual phrases", etc. but are not restricted tobe any one of them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clusteringproblem on a huge dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure whichalternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, whileapplying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. Thepaper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patchesas an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting that it could beused in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discriminativepatches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification,where they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67dataset.

Fienberg category:stat.AP stat.ME stat.ML stat.OT published:2012-05-14 summary:We present a probabilistic method for linking multiple datafiles. This taskis not trivial in the absence of unique identifiers for the individualsrecorded. This is a common scenario when linking census data to coveragemeasurement surveys for census coverage evaluation, and in general whenmultiple record-systems need to be integrated for posterior analysis. Ourmethod generalizes the Fellegi-Sunter theory for linking records from twodatafiles and its modern implementations. The multiple record linkage goal isto classify the record K-tuples coming from K datafiles according to thedifferent matching patterns. Our method incorporates the transitivity ofagreement in the computation of the data used to model matching probabilities.We use a mixture model to fit matching probabilities via maximum likelihoodusing the EM algorithm. We present a method to decide the record K-tuplesmembership to the subsets of matching patterns and we prove its optimality. Weapply our method to the integration of three Colombian homicide record systemsand we perform a simulation study in order to explore the performance of themethod under measurement error and different scenarios. The proposed methodworks well and opens some directions for future research.

Unfortunately, finding the resultingBayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomesenormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method forapproximate Bayes-optimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Ourapproach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a significantmargin on several well-known benchmark problems -- because it avoids expensiveapplications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling modelsfrom the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach byshowing it working in an infinite state space domain which is qualitatively outof reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration.
arxiv-1205-2930 | Density Sensitive Hashing |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2930  | author:Yue Lin, Deng Cai, Cheng Li category:cs.IR cs.LG published:2012-05-14 summary:Nearest neighbors search is a fundamental problem in various research fieldslike machine learning, data mining and pattern recognition. Recently,hashing-based approaches, e.g., Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), are proved tobe effective for scalable high dimensional nearest neighbors search. Manyhashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since thesealgorithms generate the hash tables (projections) randomly, a large number ofhash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required in order to achieve both highprecision and recall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hashingalgorithm called {\em Density Sensitive Hashing} (DSH) in this paper. DSH canbe regarded as an extension of LSH. By exploring the geometric structure of thedata, DSH avoids the purely random projections selection and uses thoseprojective functions which best agree with the distribution of the data.Extensive experimental results on real-world data sets have shown that theproposed method achieves better performance compared to the state-of-the-arthashing approaches.

arxiv-1205-2958 | b-Bit Minwise Hashing in Practice: Large-Scale Batch and Online Learning and Using GPUs for Fast Preprocessing with Simple Hash Functions |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2958  | author:Ping Li, Anshumali Shrivastava, Arnd Christian Konig category:cs.IR cs.DB cs.LG published:2012-05-14 summary:In this paper, we study several critical issues which must be tackled beforeone can apply b-bit minwise hashing to the volumes of data often usedindustrial applications, especially in the context of search. 1. (b-bit) Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step thatcomputes k (e.g., 500) minimal values after applying the correspondingpermutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme usingGPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. 2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantiallyreduce the amount of memory required for batch learning. However, as onlinealgorithms become increasingly popular for large-scale learning in the contextof search, it is not clear if b-bit minwise yields significant improvements forthem. This paper demonstrates that $b$-bit minwise hashing provides aneffective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramaticallyreduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process.This is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g., 10 to100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy. 3. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomesimpossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix, due to its spacerequirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that $b$-bit minwisehashing implemented using simple hash functions, e.g., the 2-universal (2U) and4-universal (4U) hash families, can produce very similar learning results asusing fully random permutations. Experiments on datasets of up to 200GB arepresented.

For the important case of piecewise stationarystochastic bandits, we show a significant improvement over existing algorithms.Our algorithms are based on a non-uniform sampling policy, which we show isessential to the success of any algorithm in the adversarial setup.

The Indian Rupee (INR) / US Dollar(USD) is used for detailed examinations. The number of input nodes has agreater impact on performance than the number of hidden nodes, while a largenumber of observations do reduce forecast errors.
arxiv-1205-2663 | Are visual dictionaries generalizable? |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2663  | author:Otavio A. B. Penatti, Eduardo Valle, Ricardo da S. Torres category:cs.CV published:2012-05-11 summary:Mid-level features based on visual dictionaries are today a cornerstone ofsystems for classification and retrieval of images. Those state-of-the-artrepresentations depend crucially on the choice of a codebook (visualdictionary), which is usually derived from the dataset. In general-purpose,dynamic image collections (e.g., the Web), one cannot have the entirecollection in order to extract a representative dictionary. However, based onthe hypothesis that the dictionary reflects only the diversity of low-levelappearances and does not capture semantics, we argue that a dictionary based ona small subset of the data, or even on an entirely different dataset, is ableto produce a good representation, provided that the chosen images span adiverse enough portion of the low-level feature space. Our experiments confirmthat hypothesis, opening the opportunity to greatly alleviate the burden ingenerating the codebook, and confirming the feasibility of employing visualdictionaries in large-scale dynamic environments.

Corresponding to each structural equation model, there is adirected acyclic graph describing the relationships between the variables. InGaussian structural equation models with linear functions, the graph can beidentified from the joint distribution only up to Markov equivalence classes,assuming faithfulness. In this work, we prove full identifiability if all noisevariables have the same variances: the directed acyclic graph can be recoveredfrom the joint Gaussian distribution. Our result has direct implications forcausal inference: if the data follow a Gaussian structural equation model withequal error variances and assuming that all variables are observed, the causalstructure can be inferred from observational data only. We propose astatistical method and an algorithm that exploit our theoretical findings.

In this paper, we propose a fastimplementation of the dGN algorithm which is based on novel expressions of theinverse approximate Hessian in block form. The new implementation has lowercomputational complexity, besides computation of the gradient (this part iscommon to both methods), requiring the inversion of a matrix of size$NR^2\times NR^2$, which is much smaller than the whole approximate Hessian, if$T \gg NR$. In addition, the implementation has lower memory requirements,because neither the Hessian nor its inverse never need to be stored in theirentirety. A variant of the algorithm working with complex valued data isproposed as well. Complexity and performance of the proposed algorithm iscompared with those of dGN and ALS with line search on examples of difficultbenchmark tensors.

Yarman Vural category:cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML published:2012-05-10 summary:A relatively recent advance in cognitive neuroscience has been multi-voxelpattern analysis (MVPA), which enables researchers to decode brain statesand/or the type of information represented in the brain during a cognitiveoperation. MVPA methods utilize machine learning algorithms to distinguishamong types of information or cognitive states represented in the brain, basedon distributed patterns of neural activity. In the current investigation, wepropose a new approach for representation of neural data for pattern analysis,namely a Mesh Learning Model. In this approach, at each time instant, a starmesh is formed around each voxel, such that the voxel corresponding to thecenter node is surrounded by its p-nearest neighbors. The arc weights of eachmesh are estimated from the voxel intensity values by least squares method. Theestimated arc weights of all the meshes, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs),are then used to train a classifier, such as Neural Networks, k-NearestNeighbor, Na\"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The proposed Mesh Modelwas tested on neuroimaging data acquired via functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI) during a recognition memory experiment using categorized wordlists, employing a previously established experimental paradigm (\"Oztekin &Badre, 2011). Results suggest that the proposed Mesh Learning approach canprovide an effective algorithm for pattern analysis of brain activity duringcognitive processing.

We specially choose this regularization because it isknown that Tikhonov regularized least square (LS) is the more preferable formin solving linear inverse problems than the conventional LS. Because an NMFproblem can be decomposed into LS subproblems, it can be expected that Tikhonovregularized NMF will be the more appropriate approach in solving NMF problems.The algorithm is derived using additive update rules which have been shown tohave convergence guarantee. We equip the algorithm with a mechanism toautomatically determine the regularization parameters based on the L-curve, awell-known concept in the inverse problems community, but is rather unknown inthe NMF research. The introduction of this algorithm thus solves two inherentproblems in Tikhonov regularized NMF algorithm research, i.e., convergenceguarantee and regularization parameters determination.

We first provide a general formulation of the kernel dependencyestimation (KDE) problem using operator-valued kernels. We show that some ofthe existing formulations of this problem are special cases of our framework.We then propose a covariance-based operator-valued kernel that allows us totake into account the structure of the kernel feature space. This kerneloperates on the output space and encodes the interactions between the outputswithout any reference to the input space. To address this issue, we introduce avariant of our KDE method based on the conditional covariance operator that inaddition to the correlation between the outputs takes into account the effectsof the input variables. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our KDEapproach using both covariance and conditional covariance kernels on twostructured output problems, and compare it to the state-of-the-art kernel-basedstructured output regression methods.

In every state of India thereare two languages one is state local language and the other is English. Forexample in Andhra Pradesh, a state in India, the document may contain textwords in English and Telugu script. For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) ofsuch a bilingual document, it is necessary to identify the script beforefeeding the text words to the OCRs of individual scripts. In this paper, we areintroducing a simple and efficient technique of script identification forKannada, English and Hindi text words of a printed document. The proposedapproach is based on the horizontal and vertical projection profile for thediscrimination of the three scripts. The feature extraction is done based onthe horizontal projection profile of each text words. We analysed 700 differentwords of Kannada, English and Hindi in order to extract the discriminationfeatures and for the development of knowledge base. We use the horizontalprojection profile of each text word and based on the horizontal projectionprofile we extract the appropriate features. The proposed system is tested on100 different document images containing more than 1000 text words of eachscript and a classification rate of 98.25%, 99.25% and 98.87% is achieved forKannada, English and Hindi respectively.

In particular, we first study thefirst-order optimality conditions for these problems. We then propose penaltydecomposition (PD) methods for solving them in which a sequence of penaltysubproblems are solved by a block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Under somesuitable assumptions, we establish that any accumulation point of the sequencegenerated by the PD methods satisfies the first-order optimality conditions ofthe problems. Furthermore, for the problems in which the $l_0$ part is the onlynonconvex part, we show that such an accumulation point is a local minimizer ofthe problems. In addition, we show that any accumulation point of the sequencegenerated by the BCD method is a saddle point of the penalty subproblem.Moreover, for the problems in which the $l_0$ part is the only nonconvex part,we establish that such an accumulation point is a local minimizer of thepenalty subproblem. Finally, we test the performance of our PD methods byapplying them to sparse logistic regression, sparse inverse covarianceselection, and compressed sensing problems. The computational resultsdemonstrate that our methods generally outperform the existing methods in termsof solution quality and/or speed.

Littman category:cs.LG cs.AI published:2012-05-09 summary:This paper presents a new algorithm for online linear regression whoseefficiency guarantees satisfy the requirements of the KWIK (Knows What ItKnows) framework. The algorithm improves on the complexity bounds of thecurrent state-of-the-art procedure in this setting. We explore severalapplications of this algorithm for learning compact reinforcement-learningrepresentations. We show that KWIK linear regression can be used to learn thereward function of a factored MDP and the probabilities of action outcomes inStochastic STRIPS and Object Oriented MDPs, none of which have been proven tobe efficiently learnable in the RL setting before. We also combine KWIK linearregression with other KWIK learners to learn larger portions of these models,including experiments on learning factored MDP transition and reward functionstogether.

Instead of focussing on a single optimalparameter value we propose to treat parameters as dynamical quantities. Weintroduce an algorithm to generate complex dynamics for parameters and (bothvisible and hidden) state vectors. We show that under certain conditionsaverages computed over trajectories of the proposed dynamical system convergeto averages computed over the data. Our "herding dynamics" does not requireexpensive operations such as exponentiation and is fully deterministic.

To understand the structuralbehavior of nodes in these large dynamic networks, it may be necessary to modelthe dynamics of behavioral roles representing the main connectivity patternsover time. In this paper, we propose a dynamic behavioral mixed-membershipmodel (DBMM) that captures the roles of nodes in the graph and how they evolveover time. Unlike other node-centric models, our model is scalable foranalyzing large dynamic networks. In addition, DBMM is flexible,parameter-free, has no functional form or parameterization, and isinterpretable (identifies explainable patterns). The performance resultsindicate our approach can be applied to very large networks while theexperimental results show that our model uncovers interesting patternsunderlying the dynamics of these networks.

Hinton category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-05-09 summary:Products of Hidden Markov Models(PoHMMs) are an interesting class ofgenerative models which have received little attention since theirintroduction. This maybe in part due to their more computationally expensivegradient-based learning algorithm,and the intractability of computing the loglikelihood of sequences under the model. In this paper, we demonstrate how thepartition function can be estimated reliably via Annealed Importance Sampling.We perform experiments using contrastive divergence learning on rainfall dataand data captured from pairs of people dancing. Our results suggest thatadvances in learning and evaluation for undirected graphical models and recentincreases in available computing power make PoHMMs worth considering forcomplex time-series modeling tasks.

A recent characterization states that a generalclass of regularization functionals with differentiable regularizer admits alinear representer theorem if and only if the regularization term is anon-decreasing function of the norm. In this report, we improve over suchresult by replacing the differentiability assumption with lower semi-continuityand deriving a proof that is independent of the dimensionality of the space.

One main drawback of theiralgorithms is the requirement of a special structure prior that is non uniformand does not respect Markov equivalence. In this paper, we develop an algorithmthat can compute the exact posterior probability of a subnetwork in O(3n) timeand the posterior probabilities for all n(n-1) potential edges in O(n3n) totaltime. Our algorithm also assumes a bounded indegree but allows generalstructure priors. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on severaldata sets with up to 20 variables.

In this paper, we investigate themost common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There aremany methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrixfactorization (MF) or adaptive knearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though thesemethods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, noneof them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a genericoptimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximumposterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We alsoprovide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect toBPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent withbootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-artrecommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experimentsindicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization methodoutperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results showthe importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.

Multi-scale test statistic on asingle cell is derived based on likelihood ratio statistic for Bernoullisequence, Poisson sequence and Normal sequence. A neighborhood variabilitymeasure is defined to select the optimal test threshold. The MCD method iscompared with single scale testing methods controlling for false discovery rateand the spatial scan statistics using simulation and f-MRI data. The MCD methodis shown to be more effective for discovering irregularly shaped clusters, andthe implementation of this method does not require heavy computation, making itsuitable for cluster detection for large spatial data.

For example, this problem arises naturally when tryingto automatically assign gene function using a controlled vocabularies like GeneOntology. However, most existing approaches for predicting gene functions solveindependent classification problems to predict genes that are involved in agiven function category, independently of the rest. Here, we propose two simplemethods for incorporating information about the hierarchical nature of thecategorization scheme. In the first method, we use information about a gene'sprevious annotation to set an initial prior on its label. In a second approach,we extend a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm for predicting genefunction in a hierarchy. We show that we can efficiently solve this problem bysolving a linear system of equations. We compare these approaches with aprevious label reconciliation-based approach. Results show that using thehierarchy information directly, compared to using reconciliation methods,improves gene function prediction.

Thisrepresentation can be used to model the effects of interventions, and theindependence properties encoded in this model can be represented as a directedgraph that allows cycles. In addition to discussing inference and sampling withthis representation, we give an exponential family parametrization that allowsparameter estimation to be stated as a convex optimization problem; we alsogive a convex relaxation of the task of simultaneous parameter and structurelearning using group l1-regularization. The model is evaluated on simulateddata and intracellular flow cytometry data.
arxiv-1205-2611 | Ordinal Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2611  | author:Tran The Truyen, Dinh Q. Phung, Svetha Venkatesh category:cs.IR cs.LG published:2012-05-09 summary:Collaborative filtering is an effective recommendation technique wherein thepreference of an individual can potentially be predicted based on preferencesof other members. Early algorithms often relied on the strong locality in thepreference data, that is, it is enough to predict preference of a user on aparticular item based on a small subset of other users with similar tastes orof other items with similar properties. More recently, dimensionality reductiontechniques have proved to be equally competitive, and these are based on theco-occurrence patterns rather than locality. This paper explores and extends aprobabilistic model known as Boltzmann Machine for collaborative filteringtasks. It seamlessly integrates both the similarity and co-occurrence in aprincipled manner. In particular, we study parameterisation options to dealwith the ordinal nature of the preferences, and propose a joint modelling ofboth the user-based and item-based processes. Experiments on moderate andlarge-scale movie recommendation show that our framework rivals existingwell-known methods.
arxiv-1205-2623 | Virtual Vector Machine for Bayesian Online Classification |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2623  | author:Thomas P. Minka, Rongjing Xiang, Yuan, Qi category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2012-05-09 summary:In a typical online learning scenario, a learner is required to process alarge data stream using a small memory buffer. Such a requirement is usually inconflict with a learner's primary pursuit of prediction accuracy. To addressthis dilemma, we introduce a novel Bayesian online classi cation algorithm,called the Virtual Vector Machine. The virtual vector machine allows you tosmoothly trade-off prediction accuracy with memory size. The virtual vectormachine summarizes the information contained in the preceding data stream by aGaussian distribution over the classi cation weights plus a constant number ofvirtual data points. The virtual data points are designed to add extranon-Gaussian information about the classi cation weights. To maintain theconstant number of virtual points, the virtual vector machine adds the currentreal data point into the virtual point set, merges two most similar virtualpoints into a new virtual point or deletes a virtual point that is far from thedecision boundary. The information lost in this process is absorbed into theGaussian distribution. The extra information provided by the virtual pointsleads to improved predictive accuracy over previous online classificationalgorithms.

Here we examine this same question, with acombination of theory and experiments, for a broader class of trees thatincludes k-d trees, dyadic trees, and PCA trees. Our motivation is to get afeel for (i) the kind of intrinsic low dimensional structure that can beempirically verified, (ii) the extent to which a spatial partition can exploitsuch structure, and (iii) the implications for standard statistical tasks suchas regression, vector quantization, and nearest neighbor search.

In particular, we concentrate on the case that efficient algorithms foruniform sampling from the output space exist. We show that under thisassumption (i) exact computation of the partition function remains a hardproblem, and (ii) the partition function and the gradient of the log partitionfunction can be approximated efficiently. Our main result is an approximationscheme for the partition function based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo theory. Wealso show that the efficient uniform sampling assumption holds in severalapplication settings that are of importance in machine learning.

Questions like "What distinguishes aclustering of data from other data partitioning?", "Are there any principlesgoverning all clustering paradigms?", "How should a user choose an appropriateclustering algorithm for a particular task?", etc. are almost completelyunanswered by the existing body of clustering literature. We consider anaxiomatic approach to the theory of Clustering. We adopt the framework ofKleinberg, [Kle03]. By relaxing one of Kleinberg's clustering axioms, wesidestep his impossibility result and arrive at a consistent set of axioms. Wesuggest to extend these axioms, aiming to provide an axiomatic taxonomy ofclustering paradigms. Such a taxonomy should provide users some guidanceconcerning the choice of the appropriate clustering paradigm for a given task.The main result of this paper is a set of abstract properties that characterizethe Single-Linkage clustering function. This characterization result providesnew insight into the properties of desired data groupings that makeSingle-Linkage the appropriate choice. We conclude by considering a taxonomy ofclustering functions based on abstract properties that each satisfies.

However, its identifiability has not beenproperly addressed, and how to apply it in the case of more than two variablesis also a problem. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on itsidentifiability in the two-variable case. We show that this model isidentifiable in most cases; by enumerating all possible situations in which themodel is not identifiable, we provide sufficient conditions for itsidentifiability. Simulations are given to support the theoretical results.Moreover, in the case of more than two variables, we show that the whole causalstructure can be found by applying the PNL causal model to each structure inthe Markov equivalent class and testing if the disturbance is independent ofthe direct causes for each variable. In this way the exhaustive search over allpossible causal structures is avoided.

Many recent works presentimprovements on the basic LBP algorithm in an attempt to overcome convergenceand local optima problems. Notable among these are convexified free energyapproximations that lead to inference procedures with provable convergence andquality properties. However, empirically LBP still outperforms most of itsconvex variants in a variety of settings, as we also demonstrate here.Motivated by this fact we seek convexified free energies that directlyapproximate the Bethe free energy. We show that the proposed approximationscompare favorably with state-of-the art convex free energy approximations.

Xing category:stat.ML q-bio.GN q-bio.QM stat.AP published:2012-05-09 summary:We consider the problem of learning a high-dimensional multi-task regressionmodel, under sparsity constraints induced by presence of grouping structures onthe input covariates and on the output predictors. This problem is primarilymotivated by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, of which thegoal is to discover genetic variations in the genome (inputs) that influencethe expression levels of multiple co-expressed genes (outputs), eitherepistatically, or pleiotropically, or both. A structured input-output lasso(SIOL) model based on an intricate l1/l2-norm penalty over the regressioncoefficient matrix is employed to enable discovery of complex sparseinput/output relationships; and a highly efficient new optimization algorithmcalled hierarchical group thresholding (HiGT) is developed to solve theresultant non-differentiable, non-separable, and ultra high-dimensionaloptimization problem. We show on both simulation and on a yeast eQTL datasetthat our model leads to significantly better recovery of the structured sparserelationships between the inputs and the outputs, and our algorithmsignificantly outperforms other optimization techniques under the same model.Additionally, we propose a novel approach for efficiently and effectivelydetecting input interactions by exploiting the prior knowledge available frombiological experiments.

When these algorithms converge, theycan be shown to find local (or sometimes even global) optima of variationalformulations to the inference problem. But many of the most popular algorithmsare not guaranteed to converge. This has lead to recent interest in convergentmessage-passing algorithms. In this paper, we present a unified view ofconvergent message-passing algorithms. We present a simple derivation of anabstract algorithm, tree-consistency bound optimization (TCBO) that is provablyconvergent in both its sum and max product forms. We then show that many of theexisting convergent algorithms are instances of our TCBO algorithm, and obtainnovel convergent algorithms "for free" by exchanging maximizations andsummations in existing algorithms. In particular, we show that Wainwright'snon-convergent sum-product algorithm for tree based variational bounds, isactually convergent with the right update order for the case where trees aremonotonic chains.

Thispenalized likelihood approach results in a tractable convexoptimization problem. In this paper, we reinterpret these results as performingMAP estimation under a novel prior which we call the group l1 and l1,2positivedefinite matrix distributions. This enables us to build a hierarchicalmodel in which the l1 regularization terms vary depending on which group theentries are assigned to, which in turn allows us to learn block structuredsparse GGMs with unknown group assignments. Exact inference in thishierarchical model is intractable, due to the need to compute the normalizationconstant of these matrix distributions. However, we derive upper bounds on thepartition functions, which lets us use fast variational inference (optimizing alower bound on the joint posterior). We show that on two real world data sets(motion capture and financial data), our method which infers the blockstructure outperforms a method that uses a fixed block structure, which in turnoutperforms baseline methods that ignore block structure.

However, as it is provided by humans, domainknowledge can only be specified with some degree of uncertainty. We propose toexplicitly model such uncertainty through probabilistic constraints over theparameter space. In contrast to hard parameter constraints, our approach iseffective also when the domain knowledge is inaccurate and generally results insuperior modeling accuracy.

Our resultsbuild on our previous work [12], but significantly broaden the scope of thatwork in several directions. We extend previous multiple source loss guaranteesbased on distribution weighted combinations to arbitrary target distributionsP, not necessarily mixtures of the source distributions, analyze both known andunknown target distribution cases, and prove a lower bound. We further extendour bounds to deal with the case where the learner receives an approximatedistribution for each source instead of the exact one, and show that similarloss guarantees can be achieved depending on the divergence between theapproximate and true distributions. We also analyze the case where the labelingfunctions of the source domains are somewhat different. Finally, we report theresults of experiments with both an artificial data set and a sentimentanalysis task, showing the performance benefits of the distribution weightedcombinations and the quality of our bounds based on the Renyi divergence.

We consider the l2,1-norm regularized regression model for jointfeature selection from multiple tasks, which can be derived in theprobabilistic framework by assuming a suitable prior from the exponentialfamily. One appealing feature of the l2,1-norm regularization is that itencourages multiple predictors to share similar sparsity patterns. However, theresulting optimization problem is challenging to solve due to thenon-smoothness of the l2,1-norm regularization. In this paper, we propose toaccelerate the computation by reformulating it as two equivalent smooth convexoptimization problems which are then solved via the Nesterov's method-anoptimal first-order black-box method for smooth convex optimization. A keybuilding block in solving the reformulations is the Euclidean projection. Weshow that the Euclidean projection for the first reformulation can beanalytically computed, while the Euclidean projection for the second one can becomputed in linear time. Empirical evaluations on several data sets verify theefficiency of the proposed algorithms.

M-FISH (Multiplex Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization) providescolor karyotyping. In this paper, an automated method for M-FISH chromosomesegmentation based on watershed transform followed by naive Bayesclassification of each region using the features, mean and standard deviation,is presented. Also, a post processing step is added to re-classify the smallchromosome segments to the neighboring larger segment for reducing the chancesof misclassification. The approach provided improved accuracy when compared tothe pixel-by-pixel approach. The approach was tested on 40 images from thedataset and achieved an accuracy of 84.21 %.

CC can be used forestimating Shannon entropy, which can be approximated by certain functions ofthe ath frequency moments as a -> 1. Monitoring Shannon entropy for anomalydetection (e.g., DDoS attacks) in large networks is an important task. Thispaper presents a new algorithm for improving CC. The improvement is mostsubstantial when a -> 1--. For example, when a = 0:99, the new algorithmreduces the estimation variance roughly by 100-fold. This new algorithm wouldmake CC considerably more practical for estimating Shannon entropy.Furthermore, the new algorithm is statistically optimal when a = 0.5.

The method assumes that thetwo effects of the confounder are (possibly nonlinear) functions of theconfounder plus independent, additive noise. We discuss under which conditionsthe model is identifiable (up to an arbitrary reparameterization of theconfounder) from the joint distribution of the effects. We state and prove atheoretical result that provides evidence for the conjecture that the model isgenerically identifiable under suitable technical conditions. In addition, wepropose a practical method to estimate the confounder from a finite i.i.d.sample of the effects and illustrate that the method works well on bothsimulated and real-world data.
arxiv-1205-2641 | Bayesian Discovery of Linear Acyclic Causal Models |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2641  | author:Patrik O. Hoyer, Antti Hyttinen category:stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME published:2012-05-09 summary:Methods for automated discovery of causal relationships fromnon-interventional data have received much attention recently. A widely usedand well understood model family is given by linear acyclic causal models(recursive structural equation models). For Gaussian data both constraint-basedmethods (Spirtes et al., 1993; Pearl, 2000) (which output a single equivalenceclass) and Bayesian score-based methods (Geiger and Heckerman, 1994) (whichassign relative scores to the equivalence classes) are available. On thecontrary, all current methods able to utilize non-Gaussianity in the data(Shimizu et al., 2006; Hoyer et al., 2008) always return only a single graph ora single equivalence class, and so are fundamentally unable to express thedegree of certainty attached to that output. In this paper we develop aBayesian score-based approach able to take advantage of non-Gaussianity whenestimating linear acyclic causal models, and we empirically demonstrate that,at least on very modest size networks, its accuracy is as good as or betterthan existing methods. We provide a complete code package (in R) whichimplements all algorithms and performs all of the analysis provided in thepaper, and hope that this will further the application of these methods tosolving causal inference problems.

We propose a number of modifications in order to make thisapproach more practical in general, higher-dimensional spaces. We firstintroduce a new target distribution which is able to incorporate more rewardinformation from sampled trajectories. We also show how to break strongcorrelations between the policy parameters and sampled trajectories in order tosample more freely. Finally, we show how to incorporate these techniques in aprincipled manner to obtain estimates of the optimal policy.

We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial timeto a near-optimal allocation policy; prior results for similar problems instochastic inventory control guaranteed only asymptotic convergence andexamined variants in which each venue could be treated independently. Ouranalysis bears a strong resemblance to that of efficient exploration/exploitation schemes in the reinforcement learning literature. We describe anextensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm on the Dark Pool Problemusing real trading data.

Shelton category:cs.SI cs.LG physics.soc-ph stat.ML published:2012-05-09 summary:We demonstrate that a number of sociology models for social network dynamicscan be viewed as continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs). A sampling-basedapproximate inference method for CTBNs can be used as the basis of anexpectation-maximization procedure that achieves better accuracy in estimatingthe parameters of the model than the standard method of momentsalgorithmfromthe sociology literature. We extend the existing social networkmodels to allow for indirect and asynchronous observations of the links. AMarkov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for this new model permitsestimation and inference. We provide results on both a synthetic network (forverification) and real social network data.

When the number of hidden features is unknown, the Indian BuffetProcess (IBP) is a nonparametric latent feature model that does not bound thenumber of active features in dataset. However, the IBP assumes that all latentfeatures are uncorrelated, making it inadequate for many realworld problems. Weintroduce a framework for correlated nonparametric feature models, generalisingthe IBP. We use this framework to generate several specific models anddemonstrate applications on realworld datasets.

Instead, the training data canbe used to learn the kernel by selecting it out of a given family, such as thatof non-negative linear combinations of p base kernels, constrained by a traceor L1 regularization. This paper studies the problem of learning kernels withthe same family of kernels but with an L2 regularization instead, and forregression problems. We analyze the problem of learning kernels with ridgeregression. We derive the form of the solution of the optimization problem andgive an efficient iterative algorithm for computing that solution. We present anovel theoretical analysis of the problem based on stability and give learningbounds for orthogonal kernels that contain only an additive term O(pp/m) whencompared to the standard kernel ridge regression stability bound. We alsoreport the results of experiments indicating that L1 regularization can lead tomodest improvements for a small number of kernels, but to performancedegradations in larger-scale cases. In contrast, L2 regularization neverdegrades performance and in fact achieves significant improvements with a largenumber of kernels.

Bradley, J Andrew Bagnell category:cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML published:2012-05-09 summary:Inspired by recent work on convex formulations of clustering (Lashkari &Golland, 2008; Nowozin & Bakir, 2008) we investigate a new formulation of theSparse Coding Problem (Olshausen & Field, 1997). In sparse coding we attempt tosimultaneously represent a sequence of data-vectors sparsely (i.e. sparseapproximation (Tropp et al., 2006)) in terms of a 'code' defined by a set ofbasis elements, while also finding a code that enables such an approximation.As existing alternating optimization procedures for sparse coding aretheoretically prone to severe local minima problems, we propose a convexrelaxation of the sparse coding problem and derive a boosting-style algorithm,that (Nowozin & Bakir, 2008) serves as a convex 'master problem' which calls a(potentially non-convex) sub-problem to identify the next code element to add.Finally, we demonstrate the properties of our boosted coding algorithm on animage denoising task.

From these documents, MuTo uses stochastic EM tosimultaneously discover both a matching between the languages and multilinguallatent topics. We demonstrate that MuTo is able to find shared topics onreal-world multilingual corpora, successfully pairing related documents acrosslanguages. MuTo provides a new framework for creating multilingual topic modelswithout needing carefully curated parallel corpora and allows applicationsbuilt using the topic model formalism to be applied to a much wider class ofcorpora.
arxiv-1205-1975 | Expressivity of Time-Varying Graphs and the Power of Waiting in Dynamic Networks |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1975  | author:Arnaud Casteigts, Paola Flocchini, Emmanuel Godard, Nicola Santoro, Masafumi Yamashita category:cs.DC cs.CL published:2012-05-09 summary:In infrastructure-less highly dynamic networks, computing and performing evenbasic tasks (such as routing and broadcasting) is a very challenging activitydue to the fact that connectivity does not necessarily hold, and the networkmay actually be disconnected at every time instant. Clearly the task ofdesigning protocols for these networks is less difficult if the environmentallows waiting (i.e., it provides the nodes with store-carry-forward-likemechanisms such as local buffering) than if waiting is not feasible. Noquantitative corroborations of this fact exist (e.g., no answer to thequestion: how much easier?). In this paper, we consider these qualitativequestions about dynamic networks, modeled as time-varying (or evolving) graphs,where edges exist only at some times. We examine the difficulty of the environment in terms of the expressivity ofthe corresponding time-varying graph; that is in terms of the languagegenerated by the feasible journeys in the graph. We prove that the set oflanguages $L_{nowait}$ when no waiting is allowed contains all computablelanguages. On the other end, using algebraic properties of quasi-orders, weprove that $L_{wait}$ is just the family of regular languages. In other words,we prove that, when waiting is no longer forbidden, the power of the acceptingautomaton (difficulty of the environment) drops drastically from being aspowerful as a Turing machine, to becoming that of a Finite-State machine. This(perhaps surprisingly large) gap is a measure of the computational power ofwaiting. We also study bounded waiting; that is when waiting is allowed at a node onlyfor at most $d$ time units. We prove the negative result that $L_{wait[d]} =L_{nowait}$; that is, the expressivity decreases only if the waiting is finitebut unpredictable (i.e., under the control of the protocol designer and not ofthe environment).

Jordan category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2012-05-09 summary:In intractable, undirected graphical models, an intuitive way of creatingstructured mean field approximations is to select an acyclic tractablesubgraph. We show that the hardness of computing the objective function andgradient of the mean field objective qualitatively depends on a simple graphproperty. If the tractable subgraph has this property- we call such subgraphsv-acyclic-a very fast block coordinate ascent algorithm is possible. If not,optimization is harder, but we show a new algorithm based on the constructionof an auxiliary exponential family that can be used to make inference possiblein this case as well. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of eachregime and compare the algorithms empirically.
arxiv-1205-2602 | The Entire Quantile Path of a Risk-Agnostic SVM Classifier |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2602  | author:Jin Yu, S. V. N. Vishwanatan, Jian Zhang category:cs.LG published:2012-05-09 summary:A quantile binary classifier uses the rule: Classify x as +1 if P(Y = 1X =x) >= t, and as -1 otherwise, for a fixed quantile parameter t {[0, 1]. It hasbeen shown that Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the limit are quantileclassifiers with t = 1/2 . In this paper, we show that by using asymmetric costof misclassification SVMs can be appropriately extended to recover, in thelimit, the quantile binary classifier for any t. We then present a principledalgorithm to solve the extended SVM classifier for all values of tsimultaneously. This has two implications: First, one can recover the entireconditional distribution P(Y = 1X = x) = t for t {[0, 1]. Second, we can builda risk-agnostic SVM classifier where the cost of misclassification need not beknown apriori. Preliminary numerical experiments show the effectiveness of theproposed algorithm.

We optimize this objective functionusing a procedure that alternates between information and moment projections.Our method provides an alternate interpretation of the posterior regularizationframework (Graca et al., 2008), maintains uncertainty during optimizationunlike constraint-driven learning (Chang et al., 2007), and is more efficientthan generalized expectation criteria (Mann & McCallum, 2008). Applications ofthis framework include minimally supervised learning, semisupervised learning,and learning with constraints that are more expressive than the underlyingmodel. In experiments, we demonstrate comparable accuracy to generalizedexpectation criteria for minimally supervised learning, and use expressivestructural constraints to guide semi-supervised learning, providing a 3%-6%improvement over stateof-the-art constraint-driven learning.
arxiv-1205-2664 | A Bayesian Sampling Approach to Exploration in Reinforcement Learning |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2664  | author:John Asmuth, Lihong Li, Michael L. Littman, Ali Nouri, David Wingate category:cs.LG published:2012-05-09 summary:We present a modular approach to reinforcement learning that uses a Bayesianrepresentation of the uncertainty over models. The approach, BOSS (Best ofSampled Set), drives exploration by sampling multiple models from the posteriorand selecting actions optimistically. It extends previous work by providing arule for deciding when to resample and how to combine the models. We show thatour algorithm achieves nearoptimal reward with high probability with a samplecomplexity that is low relative to the speed at which the posteriordistribution converges during learning. We demonstrate that BOSS performs quitefavorably compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches andillustrate its flexibility by pairing it with a non-parametric model thatgeneralizes across states.

Bartlett, Ambuj Tewari category:cs.LG published:2012-05-09 summary:We provide an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret rate in an unknownweakly communicating Markov Decision Process (MDP). The algorithm proceeds inepisodes where, in each episode, it picks a policy using regularization basedon the span of the optimal bias vector. For an MDP with S states and A actionswhose optimal bias vector has span bounded by H, we show a regret bound of~O(HSpAT). We also relate the span to various diameter-like quantitiesassociated with the MDP, demonstrating how our results improve on previousregret bounds.

Various learningalgorithms have been developed in recent years, including collapsed Gibbssampling, variational inference, and maximum a posteriori estimation, and thisvariety motivates the need for careful empirical comparisons. In this paper, wehighlight the close connections between these approaches. We find that the maindifferences are attributable to the amount of smoothing applied to the counts.When the hyperparameters are optimized, the differences in performance amongthe algorithms diminish significantly. The ability of these algorithms toachieve solutions of comparable accuracy gives us the freedom to selectcomputationally efficient approaches. Using the insights gained from thiscomparative study, we show how accurate topic models can be learned in severalseconds on text corpora with thousands of documents.

Thelearner repeatedly chooses an action, the environment responds with an outcome,and then the learner receives a reward for the played action. The goal of thelearner is to maximize his total reward. However, there are situations inwhich, in addition to maximizing the cumulative reward, there are someadditional constraints on the sequence of decisions that must be satisfied onaverage by the learner. In this paper we study an extension to the onlinelearning where the learner aims to maximize the total reward given that someadditional constraints need to be satisfied. By leveraging on the theory ofLagrangian method in constrained optimization, we propose Lagrangianexponentially weighted average (LEWA) algorithm, which is a primal-dual variantof the well known exponentially weighted average algorithm, to efficientlysolve constrained online decision making problems. Using novel theoreticalanalysis, we establish the regret and the violation of the constraint bounds infull information and bandit feedback models.

This paper describes a new class of approximate dynamicprogramming (ADP) methods- distributionally robust ADP-that address the curseof dimensionality by minimizing a pessimistic bound on the policy loss. Thisapproach turns ADP into an optimization problem, for which we derive newmathematical program formulations and analyze its properties. DRADP improves onthe theoretical guarantees of existing ADP methods-it guarantees convergenceand L1 norm based error bounds. The empirical evaluation of DRADP shows thatthe theoretical guarantees translate well into good performance on benchmarkproblems.

Previously,this spectrum is analyzed for more than 400 syllables without distinguishingthe four intonations. In the current study, the spectrum with 1280 tonedsyllables is analyzed by logarithmic function, Beta rank function, andpiecewise logarithmic function. Out of the three fitting functions, thetwo-piece logarithmic function fits the data the best, both by the smallest sumof squared errors (SSE) and by the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC)value. The Beta rank function is the close second. By sampling from a Poissondistribution whose parameter value is chosen from the observed data, weempirically estimate the $p$-value for testing thetwo-piece-logarithmic-function being better than the Beta rank functionhypothesis, to be 0.16. For practical purposes, the piecewise logarithmicfunction and the Beta rank function can be considered a tie.

Partof the challenge of statistical function tagging for Myanmar sentences comesfrom the fact that Myanmar has free-phrase-order and a complex morphologicalsystem. Function tagging is a pre-processing step for parsing. In the task offunction tagging, we use the functional annotated corpus and tag Myanmarsentences with correct segmentation, POS (part-of-speech) tagging and chunkinginformation. We propose Myanmar grammar rules and apply context free grammar(CFG) to find out the parse tree of function tagged Myanmar sentences.Experiments show that our analysis achieves a good result with parsing ofsimple sentences and three types of complex sentences.

One application of this system is in Speaker Diarizationsystems. There are several methods for speaker segmentation; however, most ofthe Speaker Diarization Systems use BIC-based Segmentation methods. The maingoal of this paper is to propose a new method for speaker segmentation withhigher speed than the current methods - e.g. BIC - and acceptable accuracy. Ourproposed method is based on the pitch frequency of the speech. The accuracy ofthis method is similar to the accuracy of common speaker segmentation methods.However, its computation cost is much less than theirs. We show that our methodis about 2.4 times faster than the BIC-based method, while the average accuracyof pitch-based method is slightly higher than that of the BIC-based method.

However for real applications,further enhancement of this accuracy levels are required. One of the bottlenecks in further enhancement of the accuracy is identified as close-matchingcharacters.

The output of a state of the art of OCR is taken andcharacters falling into the close-matching character set is further fed intothis specialised classifier for enhancing the accuracy. The classifier is basedon support vector machine algorithm and uses feature vectors derived out ofspectral coefficients of projection histogram signals of close-matchingcharacters.

arxiv-1205-1496 | Graph-based Learning with Unbalanced Clusters |  http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1496  | author:Jing Qian, Venkatesh Saligrama, Manqi Zhao category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2012-05-07 summary:Graph construction is a crucial step in spectral clustering (SC) andgraph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Spectral methods applied onstandard graphs such as full-RBF, $\epsilon$-graphs and $k$-NN graphs can leadto poor performance in the presence of proximal and unbalanced data. This isbecause spectral methods based on minimizing RatioCut or normalized cut onthese graphs tend to put more importance on balancing cluster sizes overreducing cut values. We propose a novel graph construction technique and showthat the RatioCut solution on this new graph is able to handle proximal andunbalanced data. Our method is based on adaptively modulating the neighborhooddegrees in a $k$-NN graph, which tends to sparsify neighborhoods in low densityregions. Our method adapts to data with varying levels of unbalancedness andcan be naturally used for small cluster detection. We justify our ideas throughlimit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on syntheticand real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Rao category:stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP published:2012-05-07 summary:Fetal ECG (FECG) telemonitoring is an important branch in telemedicine. Thedesign of a telemonitoring system via a wireless body-area network with lowenergy consumption for ambulatory use is highly desirable. As an emergingtechnique, compressed sensing (CS) shows great promise incompressing/reconstructing data with low energy consumption. However, due tosome specific characteristics of raw FECG recordings such as non-sparsity andstrong noise contamination, current CS algorithms generally fail in thisapplication. This work proposes to use the block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) frameworkto compress/reconstruct non-sparse raw FECG recordings. Experimental resultsshow that the framework can reconstruct the raw recordings with high quality.Especially, the reconstruction does not destroy the interdependence relationamong the multichannel recordings. This ensures that the independent componentanalysis decomposition of the reconstructed recordings has high fidelity.Furthermore, the framework allows the use of a sparse binary sensing matrixwith much fewer nonzero entries to compress recordings. Particularly, eachcolumn of the matrix can contain only two nonzero entries. This shows theframework, compared to other algorithms such as current CS algorithms andwavelet algorithms, can greatly reduce code execution in CPU in the datacompression stage.
