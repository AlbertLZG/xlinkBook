arxiv-1605-09593 | Controlling Exploration Improves Training for Deep Neural Networks | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09593 | author:Yasutoshi Ida, Yasuhiro Fujiwara, Sotetsu Iwamura category:cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML  published:2016-05-31 summary:Stochastic optimization methods are widely used for training of deep neuralnetworks. However, it is still a challenging research problem to achieveeffective training by using stochastic optimization methods. This is due to thedifficulties in finding good parameters on a loss function that have manysaddle points. In this paper, we propose a stochastic optimization methodcalled STDProp for effective training of deep neural networks. Its key idea isto effectively explore parameters on a complex surface of a loss function. Weadditionally develop momentum version of STDProp. While our approaches are easyto implement with high memory efficiency, it is more effective than otherpractical stochastic optimization methods for deep neural networks. version:1
arxiv-1605-09584 | A Sparse Representation of Complete Local Binary Pattern Histogram for Human Face Recognition | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09584 | author:Mawloud Guermoui, Mohamed L. Mekhalfi category:cs.CV  published:2016-05-31 summary:Human face recognition has been a long standing problem in computer visionand pattern recognition. Facial analysis can be viewed as a two-fold problem,namely (i) facial representation, and (ii) classification. So far, many facerepresentations have been proposed, a well-known method is the Local BinaryPattern (LBP), which has witnessed a growing interest. In this respect, wetreat in this paper the issues of face representation as well as classificationin a novel manner. On the one hand, we use a variant to LBP, so-called CompleteLocal Binary Pattern (CLBP), which differs from the basic LBP by coding a givenlocal region using a given central pixel and Sing_ Magnitude difference.Subsequently, most of LBPbased descriptors use a fixed grid to code a givenfacial image, which technique is, in most cases, not robust to pose variationand misalignment. To cope with such issue, a representative Multi-ResolutionHistogram (MH) decomposition is adopted in our work. On the other hand, havingthe histograms of the considered images extracted, we exploit their sparsity toconstruct a so-called Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC) for further faceclassification. Experimental results have been conducted on ORL face database,and pointed out the superiority of our scheme over other popularstate-of-the-art techniques. version:1

Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities ofexisting video games, animated movies to provide training data with highprecision groundtruth. However, a stumbling block is in how one can certifygeneralization of the learned models and their usefulness in real world datasets. This opens up fundamental questions such as: What is the role ofphotorealism of graphics simulations in training CNN models? Are the trainedmodels valid in reality? What are possible ways to reduce the performance bias?In this work, we begin to address theses issues systematically in the contextof urban semantic understanding with CNNs. Towards this end, we (a) propose asimple probabilistic urban scene model, (b) develop a parametric rendering toolto synthesize the data with groundtruth, followed by (c) a systematicexploration of the impact of level-of-realism on the generality of the trainedCNN model to real world; and domain adaptation concepts to minimize theperformance bias. version:1

The first step in creatinga specialized dictionary involves detecting the characteristic vocabulary ofthe domain in question. Classical methods for detecting this vocabulary involvegathering a domain corpus, calculating statistics on the terms found there, andthen comparing these statistics to a background or general language corpus.Terms which are found significantly more often in the specialized corpus thanin the background corpus are candidates for the characteristic vocabulary ofthe domain. Here we present two tools, a directed crawler, and a distributionalsemantics package, that can be used together, circumventing the need of abackground corpus. Both tools are available on the web. version:1

Wang category:cs.CV  published:2016-05-31 summary:The capacity of automatically modeling photographic composition is valuablefor many real-world machine vision applications such as digital photography,image retrieval, image understanding, and image aesthetics assessment. Thetriangle technique is among those indispensable composition methods on whichprofessional photographers often rely. This paper proposes a system that canidentify prominent triangle arrangements in two major categories ofphotographs: natural or urban scenes, and portraits. For the natural or urbanscene pictures, the focus is on the effect of linear perspective. Forportraits, we carefully examine the positioning of human subjects in a photo.We show that line analysis is highly advantageous for modeling composition inboth categories. Based on the detected triangles, new mathematical descriptorsfor composition are formulated and used to retrieve similar images. Leveragingthe rich source of high aesthetics photos online, similar approaches canpotentially be incorporated in future smart cameras to enhance a person's photocomposition skills. version:1

But despitetheir popularity, the "correctness" of the implicitly-learned attention mapshas only been assessed qualitatively by visualization of several examples. Inthis paper we focus on evaluating and improving the correctness of attention inneural image captioning models. Specifically, we propose a quantitativeevaluation metric for how well the attention maps align with human judgment,using recently released datasets with alignment between regions in images andentities in captions. We then propose novel models with different levels ofexplicit supervision for learning attention maps during training. Thesupervision can be strong when alignment between regions and caption entitiesare available, or weak when only object segments and categories are provided.We show on the popular Flickr30k and COCO datasets that introducing supervisionof attention maps during training solidly improves both attention correctnessand caption quality. version:1
arxiv-1605-09546 | Semantic-Aware Depth Super-Resolution in Outdoor Scenes | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09546 | author:Miaomiao Liu, Mathieu Salzmann, Xuming He category:cs.CV  published:2016-05-31 summary:While depth sensors are becoming increasingly popular, their spatialresolution often remains limited. Depth super-resolution therefore emerged as asolution to this problem. Despite much progress, state-of-the-art techniquessuffer from two drawbacks: (i) they rely on the assumption that intensity edgescoincide with depth discontinuities, which, unfortunately, is only true incontrolled environments; and (ii) they typically exploit the availability ofhigh-resolution training depth maps, which can often not be acquired inpractice due to the sensors' limitations. By contrast, here, we introduce anapproach to performing depth super-resolution in more challenging conditions,such as in outdoor scenes. To this end, we first propose to exploit semanticinformation to better constrain the super-resolution process. In particular, wedesign a co-sparse analysis model that learns filters from joint intensity,depth and semantic information. Furthermore, we show how low-resolutiontraining depth maps can be employed in our learning strategy. We demonstratethe benefits of our approach over state-of-the-art depth super-resolutionmethods on two outdoor scene datasets. version:1

A. Lensch category:cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO  published:2016-05-31 summary:This paper proposes an approach that predicts the road course from camerasensors leveraging deep learning techniques. Road pixels are identified bytraining a multi-scale convolutional neural network on a large number offull-scene-labeled night-time road images including adverse weather conditions.A framework is presented that applies the proposed approach to longer distanceroad course estimation, which is the basis for an augmented reality navigationapplication. In this framework long range sensor data (radar) and data from amap database are fused with short range sensor data (camera) to produce aprecise longitudinal and lateral localization and road course estimation. Theproposed approach reliably detects roads with and without lane markings andthus increases the robustness and availability of road course estimations andaugmented reality navigation. Evaluations on an extensive set of high precisionground truth data taken from a differential GPS and an inertial measurementunit show that the proposed approach reaches state-of-the-art performancewithout the limitation of requiring existing lane markings. version:1

We propose a general framework toapproximately solve large-scale semidefinite problems (SDPs) at low complexity.Our approach, referred to as biconvex relaxation (BCR), transforms a generalSDP into a specific biconvex optimization problem, which can then be solved inthe original, low-dimensional variable space at low complexity. The resultingbiconvex problem is solved using an efficient alternating minimization (AM)procedure. Since AM has the potential to get stuck in local minima, we proposea general initialization scheme that enables BCR to start close to a globaloptimum - this is key for our algorithm to quickly converge to optimal ornear-optimal solutions. We showcase the efficacy of our approach on threeapplications in computer vision, namely segmentation, co-segmentation, andmanifold metric learning. BCR achieves solution quality comparable tostate-of-the-art SDP methods with speedups between 4X and 35X. At the sametime, BCR handles a more general set of SDPs than previous approaches, whichare more specialized. version:1

To this purpose, we have designed a new multimodaldataset consisting of a set of motion capture marker 3D data and 2D videosequences where, by only analysing very similar movements in both training andtest phases, we are able to predict the underlying intention, i.e., the future,never observed, action. We also present an extensive three-fold experimentalevaluation as a baseline, customizing state-of-the-art techniques for 3D and 2Ddata analysis, and proposing fusion methods to combine the two types ofavailable data. This work constitutes a proof of concept for this new paradigmas we empirically prove the affordability of predicting intentions by analysingmotion patterns and without considering any additional contextual cues. version:1

Thebasic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a reproducingkernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in which the whole arsenal of kernel methods can beextended to probability measures. It gave rise to a great deal of research andnovel applications of positive definite kernels. The goal of this survey is togive a comprehensive review of existing works and recent advances in thisresearch area, and to discuss some of the most challenging issues and openproblems that could potentially lead to new research directions. The surveybegins with a brief introduction to the RKHS and positive definite kernelswhich forms the backbone of this survey, followed by a thorough discussion ofthe Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions, theoretical guarantees,and review of its applications. The embedding of distributions enables us toapply RKHS methods to probability measures which prompts a wide range ofapplications such as kernel two-sample testing, independent testing, groupanomaly detection, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss theHilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoreticalinsights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enablesus to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules---which are ubiquitous ingraphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning---in anon-parametric way using the new representation of distributions in RKHS. Wethen discuss relationships between this framework and other related areas.Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research directions. version:1

In this paper, we present aconvolutional neural network framework for predominant instrument recognitionin real-world polyphonic music. We train our network from fixed-length musicexcerpts with a single-labeled predominant instrument and estimate an arbitrarynumber of predominant instruments from an audio signal with a variable length.To obtain the audio-excerpt-wise result, we aggregate multiple outputs fromsliding windows over the test audio. In doing so, we investigated two differentaggregation methods: one takes the average for each instrument and the othertakes the instrument-wise sum followed by normalization. In addition, weconducted extensive experiments on several important factors that affect theperformance, including analysis window size, identification threshold, andactivation functions for neural networks to find the optimal set of parameters.Using a dataset of 10k audio excerpts from 11 instruments for evaluation, wefound that convolutional neural networks are more robust than conventionalmethods that exploit spectral features and source separation with supportvector machines. Experimental results showed that the proposed convolutionalnetwork architecture obtained an F1 measure of 0.602 for micro and 0.503 formacro, respectively, achieving 19.6% and 16.4% in performance improvementcompared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. version:1

Moreover, by using a classic owner computes paradigm, ouralgorithm can be made lock-free.

We first describe the basic CF-NADE model for CFtasks. Then we propose to improve the model by sharing parameters betweendifferent ratings. A factored version of CF-NADE is also proposed for betterscalability. Furthermore, we take the ordinal nature of the preferences intoconsideration and propose an ordinal cost to optimize CF-NADE, which showssuperior performance. Finally, CF-NADE can be extended to a deep model, withonly moderately increased computational complexity. Experimental results showthat CF-NADE with a single hidden layer beats all previous state-of-the-artmethods on MovieLens 1M, MovieLens 10M, and Netflix datasets, and adding morehidden layers can further improve the performance. version:1

Recently, surrogate-based Bayesianoptimization (BO) sub-solvers have been successfully deployed in the ALframework for a more global search in the presence of inequality constraints;however, a drawback was that expected improvement (EI) evaluations relied onMonte Carlo. Here we introduce an alternative slack variable AL, and show thatin this formulation the EI may be evaluated with library routines. The slackvariables furthermore facilitate equality as well as inequality constraints,and mixtures thereof. We show how our new slack "ALBO" compares favorably tothe original. Its superiority over conventional alternatives is reinforced onseveral mixed constraint examples. version:1

Sidiropoulos, Anthony Man-Cho So category:stat.ML  published:2016-05-31 summary:This paper considers generalized (multiview) canonical correlation analysis(GCCA) for large-scale datasets. A memory-efficient and computationallylightweight algorithm is proposed for the classic MAX-VAR GCCA formulation,which is gaining renewed interest in various applications, such as speechrecognition and natural language processing. The MAX-VAR GCCA problem can besolved optimally via eigen-decomposition of a matrix that compounds the(whitened) correlation matrices of the views. However, this route can easilylead to memory explosion and a heavy computational burden when the size of theviews becomes large. Instead, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-basedalgorithm, which avoids instantiating the correlation matrices of the views andthus can achieve substantial saving in memory. The algorithm also maintainsdata sparsity, which can be exploited to alleviate the computational burden.Consequently, the proposed algorithm is highly scalable. Despite thenon-convexity of the MAX-VAR GCCA problem, the proposed iterative algorithm isshown to converge to a globally optimal solution under certain mild conditions.The proposed framework ensures global convergence even when the subproblems areinexactly solved, which can further reduce the complexity in practice.Simulations and large-scale word embedding tasks are employed to showcase theeffectiveness of the proposed algorithm. version:1

In this paper,via dropping the task-irrelevant input variables theperformance of auto-encoders can be obviously improved .Specifically, animportance-based variable selection method is proposed to aim at finding thetask-irrelevant input variables and dropping them.It firstly estimatesimportance of each variable,and then drops the variables with importance valuelower than a threshold. In order to obtain better performance, the method canbe employed for each layer of stacked auto-encoders.

Theproposed technique is able to discriminate the type of modulation scheme whichis eventually used for demodulation followed by information extraction. Theproposed system is composed of two subsystems namely feature extractionsub-system (FESS) and classifier sub-system (CSS). The FESS consists ofcontinuous wavelet transform (CWT) for feature generation and principalcomponent analysis (PCA) for selection of the feature subset which is rich indiscriminatory information. The CSS uses the selected features to accuratelyclassify the modulation class of the received signal.

The method identifies these unusual climate states on the basisof the relation between ZW and SST patterns without any input about pastoccurrences of El Nino or La Nina. The simpler alternatives of (i) clusteringthe SST fields while disregarding their relationship with ZW patterns, or (ii)clustering the joint ZW-SST patterns, do not discover El Nino. We discuss thedegree to which our method supports a causal interpretation and use alow-dimensional toy example to explain its success over other clusteringapproaches.

Due to the rarity of occurrence of falls, there may be insufficientor no training data available for them. Therefore, standard supervised machinelearning methods may not be directly applied to handle this problem. In thispaper, we present a taxonomy for the study of fall detection from theperspective of availability of fall data. The proposed taxonomy is independentof the type of sensors used and specific feature extraction/selection methods.The taxonomy identifies different categories of classification methods for thestudy of fall detection based on the availability of their data during trainingthe classifiers. Then, we present a comprehensive literature review withinthose categories and identify the approach of treating a fall as an abnormalactivity to be a plausible research direction.

(2013) recently used tooptimize the structured support vector machine (SSVM) objective in the contextof structured prediction, though it has wider applications. The key intuitionbehind our improvements is that the estimates of block gaps maintained by BCFWreveal the block suboptimality that can be used as an adaptive criterion.First, we sample objects at each iteration of BCFW in an adaptive non-uniformway via gapbased sampling. Second, we incorporate pairwise and away-stepvariants of Frank-Wolfe into the block-coordinate setting. Third, we cacheoracle calls with a cache-hit criterion based on the block gaps.

One such method is calledactivation maximization (AM), which synthesizes an input (e.g. an image) thathighly activates a neuron. Here we dramatically improve the qualitative stateof the art of activation maximization by harnessing a powerful, learned prior:a deep generator network (DGN). The algorithm (1) generates qualitativelystate-of-the-art synthetic images that look almost real, (2) reveals thefeatures learned by each neuron in an interpretable way, (3) generalizes wellto new datasets and somewhat well to different network architectures withoutrequiring the prior to be relearned, and (4) can be considered as ahigh-quality generative method (in this case, by generating novel, creative,interesting, recognizable images). version:1

The accelerated convergence is achieved through only looking atk_n nearest clusters and using triangle inequality bounds in the assignmentstep while the divisive initialization employs an optimal 2-clustering along adirection. The worst-case time complexity per iteration of our k^2-means isO(nk_nd+k^2d), where d is the dimension of the n data points and k is thenumber of clusters and usually n << k << k_n. Compared to k-means' O(nkd)complexity, our k^2-means complexity is significantly lower, at the expense ofslightly increasing the memory complexity by O(nk_n+k^2). In our extensiveexperiments k^2-means is order(s) of magnitude faster than standard methods incomputing accurate clusterings on several standard datasets and settings withhundreds of clusters and high dimensional data. Moreover, the proposed divisiveinitialization generally leads to clustering energies comparable to thoseachieved with the standard k-means++ initialization, while being significantlyfaster. version:1

Our method influences the choice of unprocessedclauses using positive and negative examples from previous proofs. To this end,we present an efficient scheme for Naive Bayesian classification bygeneralising label occurrences to types with monoid structure. This makes itpossible to extend existing fast classifiers, which consider only positiveexamples, with negative ones. We implement the method in the higher-order logicprover Satallax, where we modify the delay with which propositions areprocessed. We evaluated our method on a simply-typed higher-order logic versionof the Flyspeck project, where it solves 26% more problems than Satallaxwithout internal guidance. version:1

While accuracy figureshave steadily increased, the resource utilisation of winning models has notbeen properly taken into account. In this work, we present a comprehensiveanalysis of important metrics in practical applications: accuracy, memoryfootprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption.Key findings are: (1) fully connected layers are largely inefficient forsmaller batches of images; (2) accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolicrelationship; (3) energy constraint are an upper bound on the maximumachievable accuracy and model complexity; (4) the number of operations is areliable estimate of the inference time.

Bronstein, Guillermo Sapiro category:cs.NA cs.LG cs.NE math.OC stat.ML 65B99  90C59  published:2016-05-30 summary:Solving inverse problems with iterative algorithms such as stochasticgradient descent is a popular technique, especially for large data. Inapplications, due to time constraints, the number of iterations one may applyis usually limited, consequently limiting the accuracy achievable by certainmethods. Given a reconstruction error one is willing to tolerate, an importantquestion is whether it is possible to modify the original iterations to obtaina faster convergence to a minimizer with the allowed error. Relying on recentrecovery techniques developed for settings in which the desired signal belongsto some low-dimensional set, we show that using a coarse estimate of this setleads to faster convergence to an error related to the accuracy of the setapproximation. Our theory ties to recent advances in sparse recovery,compressed sensing and deep learning. In particular, it provides an explanationfor the successful approximation of the ISTA solution by neural networks withlayers representing iterations. version:1

However, for real-valued functions, cardinallabels might not be accessible, or it may be difficult for an expert toconsistently assign real-valued labels over the entire set of examples. Forinstance, it is notoriously hard for consumers to reliably assign values tobundles of merchandise. Instead, it might be much easier for a consumer toreport which of two bundles she likes better. With this motivation in mind, weconsider an alternative learning model, wherein the algorithm must learn theunderlying function up to pairwise comparisons, from pairwise comparisons. Inthis model, we present a series of novel algorithms that learn over a widevariety of combinatorial function classes. These range from graph functions tobroad classes of valuation functions that are fundamentally important inmicroeconomic theory, the analysis of social networks, and machine learning,such as coverage, submodular, XOS, and subadditive functions, as well asfunctions with sparse Fourier support. version:1

The detector banks are trained to detect a total of 9,918sentiment-biased visual concepts from six major languages: English, Spanish,Italian, French, German and Chinese. In the original MVSO release,adjective-noun pair (ANP) detectors were trained for the six languages using anAlexNet-styled architecture by fine-tuning from DeepSentiBank. Here, through amore extensive set of experiments, parameter tuning, and training runs, wedetail and release higher accuracy models for detecting ANPs across sixlanguages from the same image pool and setting as in the original release usinga more modern architecture, GoogLeNet, providing comparable or betterperformance with reduced network parameter cost. In addition, since the image pool in MVSO can be corrupted by user noise fromsocial interactions, we partitioned out a sub-corpus of MVSO images based ontag-restricted queries for higher fidelity labels. We show that as a result ofthese higher fidelity labels, higher performing AlexNet-styled ANP detectorscan be trained using the tag-restricted image subset as compared to the modelsin full corpus. We release all these newly trained models for public researchuse along with the list of tag-restricted images from the MVSO dataset. version:1

Theintroduced method relies on a recently proposed framework for learning ondistributions -- by representing them with mean elements in reproducing kernelHilbert spaces (RKHS) and formulating a classification algorithm therein. Inparticular, we associate each pixel to an empirical distribution of itsneighbouring pixels, a judicious representation of which in an RKHS, inconjunction with the spectral information contained in the pixel itself, give anew explicit set of features that can be fed into a suite of standardclassification techniques -- we opt for a well-established framework of supportvector machines (SVM). Furthermore, the computational complexity is reduced viarandom Fourier features formalism. We study the consistency and the convergencerates of the proposed method and the experiments demonstrate strong performanceon hyperspectral data with gains in comparison to the state-of-the-art results. version:1

The commonapproach is to treat it as a classification problem and solve it using either asupervised learner or a semi-supervised learner. We propose an alternativeapproach by using unsupervised learning as the basis to solve this problem. TheSENC problem can be decomposed into three sub problems: detecting emerging newclasses, classifying for known classes, and updating models to enableclassification of instances of the new class and detection of more emerging newclasses. The proposed method employs completely random trees which have beenshown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learningindependently in the literature. This is the first time, as far as we know,that completely random trees are used as a single common core to solve allthree sub problems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning and model updatein data streams. We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused methodoften achieves significantly better outcomes than existingclassification-focused methods. version:1

The algorithm is shown to have, under weak assumptions, complexityO(N^(3/2)) in R^d where N is the set size, making it the first sub-quadraticexact medoid algorithm for d>1. Experiments show that it performs very well onspatial network data, frequently requiring two orders of magnitude fewerdistances than state-of-the-art approximate algorithms. We show how trimed canbe used as a component in an accelerated K-medoids algorithm, and how it can berelaxed to obtain further computational gains with an only minor loss inquality. version:2

We then use these tasks to systematicallycompare and contrast existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architectureswith our new memory-based DRL architectures. These tasks are designed toemphasize, in a controllable manner, issues that pose challenges for RL methodsincluding partial observability (due to first-person visual observations),delayed rewards, high-dimensional visual observations, and the need to useactive perception in a correct manner so as to perform well in the tasks. Whilethese tasks are conceptually simple to describe, by virtue of having all ofthese challenges simultaneously they are difficult for current DRLarchitectures. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization performance of thearchitectures on environments not used during training. The experimentalresults show that our new architectures generalize to unseen environmentsbetter than existing DRL architectures. version:1

When the image is contaminated by some noises or blurs, we can notobtain the efficient segmentation result by using direct segmentation methods.In order to efficiently segment the contaminated image, this paper proposes atwo step method based on the hybrid total variation model with a box constraintand the K-means clustering method. In the first step, the hybrid model is basedon the weighted convex combination between the total variation functional andthe high-order total variation as the regularization term to obtain theoriginal clustering data. In order to deal with non-smooth regularization term,we solve this model by employing the alternating split Bregman method. Then, inthe second step, the segmentation can be obtained by thresholding thisclustering data into different phases, where the thresholds can be given byusing the K-means clustering method. Numerical comparisons show that ourproposed model can provide more efficient segmentation results dealing with thenoise image and blurring image. version:1

Carreira-Perpi√±√°n, Mehdi Alizadeh category:cs.LG cs.DC cs.NE math.OC stat.ML  published:2016-05-30 summary:Many powerful machine learning models are based on the composition ofmultiple processing layers, such as deep nets, which gives rise to nonconvexobjective functions. A general, recent approach to optimise such "nested"functions is the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC). MAC introduces anauxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested modelinto independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps thatalternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It hasthe advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introducesparallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works withnondifferentiable layers. With large-scale problems, or when distributing thecomputation is necessary for faster training, the dataset may not fit in asingle machine. It is then essential to limit the amount of communicationbetween machines so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism. Wedescribe a general way to achieve this, ParMAC. ParMAC works on a cluster ofprocessing machines with a circular topology and alternates two steps untilconvergence: one step trains the submodels in parallel using stochasticupdates, and the other trains the coordinates in parallel. Only submodelparameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines.ParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitatesdata shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing.We study the convergence of ParMAC and propose a theoretical model of itsruntime and parallel speedup. We develop ParMAC to learn binary autoencodersfor fast, approximate image retrieval. We implement it in MPI in a distributedsystem and demonstrate nearly perfect speedups in a 128-processor cluster witha training set of 100 million high-dimensional points. version:1

We provethat for a MNN with one hidden layer, the training error is zero at everydifferentiable local minimum, for almost every dataset and dropout-like noiserealization. We then extend these results to the case of more than one hiddenlayer. Our theoretical guarantees assume essentially nothing on the trainingdata, and are verified numerically. These results suggest why the highlynon-convex loss of such MNNs can be easily optimized using local updates (e.g.,stochastic gradient descent), as observed empirically. version:2

Word embeddings show promise as adiachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robustmethodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings(PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use thismethodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using sixhistorical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose twoquantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate ofsemantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) thelaw of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemoushave higher rates of semantic change. version:1

In our approach, the encoding of sentence is a two-stageprocess. Firstly, average pooling was used over word-level bidirectional LSTM(biLSTM) to generate a first-stage sentence representation. Secondly, attentionmechanism was employed to replace average pooling on the same sentence forbetter representations. Instead of using target sentence to attend words insource sentence, we utilized the sentence's first-stage representation toattend words appeared in itself, which is called "Inner-Attention" in our paper. Experiments conducted on Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpushas proved the effectiveness of "Inner-Attention" mechanism.

However,they tend to have large problems overfitting to small data sets. Indeed, theavailable regularization methods deal with the complexity of the networkfunction only indirectly. In this paper, we study the feasibility of directlyusing the $L_2$ function norm for regularization. Two methods to integrate thisnew regularization in the stochastic backpropagation are proposed. Moreover,the convergence of these new algorithms is studied. We finally show that theyoutperform the state-of-the-art methods in the low sample regime on benchmarkdatasets (MNIST and CIFAR10).

For example, in environmentmonitoring some sensors expired whereas some new ones deployed; in mobile gamerecommendation some games dropped whereas some new ones added. Learning withsuch incremental and decremental features is crucial but rarely studied,particularly when the data coming like a stream and thus it is infeasible tokeep the whole data for optimization. In this paper, we study this challengingproblem and present the OPID approach. Our approach attempts to compressimportant information of vanished features into functions of survived features,and then expand to include the augmented features. It is the one-pass learningapproach, which only needs to scan each instance once and does not need tostore the whole data, and thus satisfy the evolving streaming data nature. Theeffectiveness of our approach is validated theoretically and empirically. version:1

Robinson category:cs.LG stat.ML H.2.8  published:2016-05-29 summary:Inverse classification is the process of manipulating an instance such thatit is more likely to conform to a specific class. Past methods that addresssuch a problem have shortcomings. Greedy methods make changes that are overlyradical, often relying on data that is strictly discrete. Other methods rely oncertain data points, the presence of which cannot be guaranteed. In this paperwe propose a general framework and method that overcomes these and otherlimitations. The formulation of our method uses any differentiableclassification function. We demonstrate the method by using Gaussian kernelSVMs. We constrain the inverse classification to occur on features that canactually be changed, each of which incurs an individual cost. We furthersubject such changes to fall within a certain level of cumulative change(budget). Our framework can also accommodate the estimation of features whosevalues change as a consequence of actions taken (indirectly changeablefeatures). Furthermore, we propose two methods for specifying feature-valueranges that result in different algorithmic behavior. We apply our method, anda proposed sensitivity analysis-based benchmark method, to two freely availabledatasets: Student Performance, from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and areal-world cardiovascular disease dataset.

For sizeableexperimentation, we contribute a new Face Attributes Dataset (FAD), havingroughly 200,000 attribute labels for the above traits, for over 10,000 facialimages. Due to the recent surge of research on Deep Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs), we begin by using a CNN architecture for estimating facialattributes and show that they indeed provide an impressive baselineperformance. To further improve performance, we propose a novel approach thatincorporates facial landmark information for input images as an additionalchannel, helping the CNN learn better attribute-specific features so that thelandmarks across various training images hold correspondence.

Inprinciple, MCMC is an exact probabilistic method which, however, often suffersfrom exponentially slow mixing. In contrast, BP is a deterministic method,which is typically fast, empirically very successful, however in generallacking control of accuracy over loopy graphs. In this paper, we introduce MCMCalgorithms correcting the approximation error of BP, i.e., we provide a way tocompensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC. Our framework isbased on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach which allows to express the BP erroras a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series iscomputationally intractable, it is known that a truncated series, summing upall 2-regular loops, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wisebinary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically.Motivated by this, we first propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC schemefor the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models. Ourmain idea here is to use the Worm algorithm, known to provide fast mixing inother (related) problems, and then design an appropriate rejection scheme tosample 2-regular loops. Furthermore, we also design an efficient rejection-freeMCMC scheme for approximating the full series. The main novelty underlying ourdesign is in utilizing the concept of cycle basis, which provides an efficientdecomposition of the generalized loops.

The paper provides explicitformulas for those errors. Unlike other classical references in this setup, ourresults take place in a fully singular setup that does not assume the existenceof a solution for the non-regularized regression problem. In exchange, weinvoke a conditional homoscedasticity hypothesis on the regularized regressionresiduals that is crucial in our developments. version:1

We prove that any bandit strategy, for atleast one bandit problem characterized by a complexity $H$, will misidentifythe best arm with probability lower bounded by$$\exp\Big(-\frac{T}{\log(K)H}\Big),$$ where $H$ is the sum for all sub-optimalarms of the inverse of the squared gaps. Our result disproves formally thegeneral belief - coming from results in the fixed confidence setting - thatthere must exist an algorithm for this problem whose probability of error isupper bounded by $\exp(-T/H)$. This also proves that some existing strategiesbased on the Successive Rejection of the arms are optimal - closing thereforethe current gap between upper and lower bounds for the fixed budget best armidentification problem. version:1

Our objective is to use this simple setting to illustratethat strategies based on an exploration phase (up to a stopping time) followedby exploitation are necessarily suboptimal. The results hold regardless ofwhether or not the difference in means between the two arms is known. Besidesthe main message, we also refine existing deviation inequalities, which allowus to design fully sequential strategies with finite-time regret guaranteesthat are (a) asymptotically optimal as the horizon grows and (b) order-optimalin the minimax sense. Furthermore we provide empirical evidence that the theoryalso holds in practice and discuss extensions to non-gaussian andmultiple-armed case. version:1

Sparse CCA is NP-hard. We propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for sparse diagonal CCA, i.e.,sparse CCA under the additional assumption that variables within each set arestandardized and uncorrelated. Our algorithm operates on a low rankapproximation of the input data and its computational complexity scaleslinearly with the number of input variables. It is simple to implement, andparallelizable. In contrast to most existing approaches, our algorithmadministers precise control on the sparsity of the extracted canonical vectors,and comes with theoretical data-dependent global approximation guarantees, thathinge on the spectrum of the input data. Finally, it can be straightforwardlyadapted to other constrained variants of CCA enforcing structure beyondsparsity. We empirically evaluate the proposed scheme and apply it on a realneuroimaging dataset to investigate associations between brain activity andbehavior measurements. version:1

Yetinteraction identification becomes challenging even for a moderate number ofcovariates. In this paper, we suggest an efficient and flexible procedure,called the interaction pursuit (IP), for interaction identification inultra-high dimensions. The suggested method first reduces the number ofinteractions and main effects to a moderate scale by a new feature screeningapproach, and then selects important interactions and main effects in thereduced feature space using regularization methods. Compared to existingapproaches, our method screens interactions separately from main effects andthus can be more effective in interaction screening. Under a fairly generalframework, we establish that for both interactions and main effects, the methodenjoys the sure screening property in screening and oracle inequalities inselection. Our method and theoretical results are supported by severalsimulation and real data examples. version:1

This paper concernsitself with one popular topological feature, which is the number of$d-$dimensional holes in the dataset, also known as the Betti$-d$ number. Thepersistence of the Betti numbers over various scales is encoded into apersistence diagram (PD), which indicates the birth and death times of theseholes as scale varies. A common way to compare PDs is by a point-to-pointmatching, which is given by the $n$-Wasserstein metric. However, a big drawbackof this approach is the need to solve correspondence between points beforecomputing the distance; for $n$ points, the complexity grows according to$\mathcal{O}($n$^3)$. Instead, we propose to use an entirely new frameworkbuilt on Riemannian geometry, that models PDs as 2D probability densityfunctions that are represented in the square-root framework on a HilbertSphere. The resulting space is much more intuitive with closed form expressionsfor common operations. The distance metric is 1) correspondence-free and also2) independent of the number of points in the dataset. The complexity ofcomputing distance between PDs now grows according to $\mathcal{O}(K^2)$, for a$K \times K$ discretization of $[0,1]^2$. This also enables the use of existingmachinery in differential geometry towards statistical analysis of PDs such ascomputing the mean, geodesics, classification etc. We report competitiveresults with the Wasserstein metric, at a much lower computational load,indicating the favorable properties of the proposed approach. version:1

Such importance degree and textrepresentation are calculated with multiple computational layers, each of whichis a neural attention model over an external memory. Experiments on laptop andrestaurant datasets demonstrate that our approach performs comparable tostate-of-art feature based SVM system, and substantially better than LSTM andattention-based LSTM architectures. On both datasets we show that multiplecomputational layers could improve the performance. Moreover, our approach isalso fast. The deep memory network with 9 layers is 15 times faster than LSTMwith a CPU implementation. version:1

Hoi, Peilin Zhao, Jianling Sun category:cs.LG cs.IR  published:2016-05-28 summary:Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) combines ideas of probabilistic matrixfactorization (PMF) and topic modeling (e.g., LDA) for recommender systems,which has gained increasing successes in many applications. Despite enjoyingmany advantages, the existing CTR algorithms have some critical limitations.First of all, they are often designed to work in a batch learning manner,making them unsuitable to deal with streaming data or big data in real-worldrecommender systems. Second, the document-specific topic proportions of LDA arefed to the downstream PMF, but not reverse, which is sub-optimal as the ratinginformation is not exploited in discovering the low-dimensional representationof documents and thus can result in a sub-optimal representation forprediction. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme of Online BayesianCollaborative Topic Regression (OBCTR) which is efficient and scalable forlearning from data streams. Particularly, we {\it jointly} optimize thecombined objective function of both PMF and LDA in an online learning fashion,in which both PMF and LDA tasks can be reinforced each other during the onlinelearning process. Our encouraging experimental results on real-world datavalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method. version:1

The MPEG standard has developed a number ofdescriptors that covers different aspects of the visual content. The Dominantcolor descriptor is one of them. This paper proposes a channelized binningapproach a novel method for extraction of the dominant color pixel value whichis a variant of the dominant color descriptor. The Channelized binning methodtreats the problem as a statistical problem and tries to avoid colorquantization and interpolation guessing of number and centroid of dominantcolors. Channelized binning is an iterative approach which automaticallyestimates the number of dominant pixel values and their centroids. It operateson 24 bit full RGB color space, by considering one color channel at a time andhence avoiding the color quantization. Results show that the proposed methodcan successfully extract dominant color pixel values. version:1

The weighted residual network is able to learnto combine residuals from different layers effectively and efficiently. Theproposed models enjoy a consistent improvement over accuracy and convergencewith increasing depths from 100+ layers to 1000+ layers. Besides, the weightedresidual networks have little more computation and GPU memory burden than theoriginal residual networks. The networks are optimized by projected stochasticgradient descent.

Active learning allows alearning algorithm to intelligently query samples to be labeled for efficientlearning. Fisher information ratio (FIR) has been used as an objective forselecting queries in active learning. However, little is known about the theorybehind the use of FIR for active learning. There is a gap between theunderlying theory and the motivation of its usage in practice. In this paper,we attempt to fill this gap and provide a rigorous framework for analyzing theexisting FIR-based active learning methods. In particular, we show that FIR canbe asymptotically viewed as an upper bound of the expected variance of thelog-likelihood ratio. Additionally, our analysis suggests a unifying frameworkthat not only enables us to make theoretical comparisons among the existingquerying methods based on FIR, but also gives more insight into the developmentof new active learning approaches based on this objective. version:1

Inour application, the (asymmetric) distances quantify private costs a userincurs when substituting one item by another. We aim to learn these distances(costs) by asking the users whether they are willing to switch from one item toanother for a given incentive offer. Without exploiting structural constraintsof the hemimetric polytope, learning the distances between each pair of itemsrequires $\Theta(n^2)$ queries. We propose an active learning algorithm thatsubstantially reduces this sample complexity by exploiting the structuralconstraints on the version space of hemimetrics. Our proposed algorithmachieves provably-optimal sample complexity for various instances of the task.For example, when the items are embedded into $K$ tight clusters, the samplecomplexity of our algorithm reduces to $O(n K)$.

Our methodstarts by the computation of stable subspaces using a novel random samplingscheme. Thus constructed preliminary subspaces are used to identify theinitially incorrectly clustered data points and then to reassign them to moresuitable clusters based on their goodness-of-fit to the preliminary model. Toimprove the robustness of the algorithm, we use a dominant nearest subspaceclassification scheme that controls the level of sensitivity againstreassignment. We demonstrate that our algorithm is convergent and superior tothe direct application of a generic alternative such as principal componentanalysis.

The state-of-the-art stochastic Riemannian algorithmrequires the learning rate to decay to zero and thus suffers from slowconvergence and sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we address this issue bydeploying the variance reduction (VR) technique of stochastic gradient descent(SGD). The technique was originally developed to solve convex problems in theEuclidean space. We generalize it to Riemannian manifolds and realize it tosolve the non-convex eigen-decomposition problem. We are the first to proposeand analyze the generalization of SVRG to Riemannian manifolds. Specifically,we propose the general variance reduction form, SVRRG, in the framework of thestochastic Riemannian gradient optimization. It's then specialized to theproblem with eigensolvers and induces the SVRRG-EIGS algorithm. We provide anovel and elegant theoretical analysis on this algorithm. The theory shows thata fixed learning rate can be used in the Riemannian setting with an exponentialglobal convergence rate guaranteed. The theoretical results make a significantimprovement over existing studies, with the effectiveness empirically verified. version:2

HMM are often trained by meansof the Baum-Welch algorithm which can be seen as a special variant of anexpectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Second-order training techniques suchas Variational Bayesian Inference (VI) for probabilistic models regard theparameters of the probabilistic models as random variables and definedistributions over these distribution parameters, hence the name of thistechnique. VI can also bee regarded as a special case of an EM algorithm. Inthis article, we bring both together and train HMM with multivariate Gaussianoutput distributions with VI.

However, they do not scale well to large-data problems.Divide-and-conquer strategies, which split the data into batches and, for eachbatch, run independent MCMC algorithms targeting the correspondingsubposterior, can spread the computational burden across a number of separateworkers. The challenge with such strategies is in recombining the subposteriorsto approximate the full posterior. By creating a Gaussian-process approximationfor each log-subposterior density we create a tractable approximation for thefull posterior. This approximation is exploited through three methodologies:firstly a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm targeting the expectation of theposterior density provides a sample from an approximation to the posterior;secondly, evaluating the true posterior at the sampled points leads to animportance sampler that, asymptotically, targets the true posteriorexpectations; finally, an alternative importance sampler uses the fullGaussian-process distribution of the approximation to the log-posterior densityto re-weight any initial sample and provide both an estimate of the posteriorexpectation and a measure of the uncertainty in it. version:1

Obtaining an API usage sequence based on anAPI-related natural language query is very helpful in this regard. Given aquery, existing approaches utilize information retrieval models to search formatching API sequences. These approaches treat queries and APIs as bag-of-words(i.e., keyword matching or word-to-word alignment) and lack a deepunderstanding of the semantics of the query. We propose DeepAPI, a deep learning based approach to generate API usagesequences for a given natural language query. Instead of a bags-of-wordsassumption, it learns the sequence of words in a query and the sequence ofassociated APIs. DeepAPI adapts a neural language model named RNNEncoder-Decoder. It encodes a word sequence (user query) into a fixed-lengthcontext vector, and generates an API sequence based on the context vector. Wealso augment the RNN Encoder-Decoder by considering the importance ofindividual APIs. We empirically evaluate our approach with more than 7 millionannotated code snippets collected from GitHub. The results show that ourapproach generates largely accurate API sequences and outperforms the relatedapproaches. version:1

These methods are ableto manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simplyrequiring to be able to draw samples from them, which is the typical setup inhigh-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretizethese densities, while giving access to provably convergent methods that outputthe correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on twomain ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of anexpectation ; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in asmooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithmsthat have a provably faster convergence. We instantiate these ideas in threedifferent setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another, weshow that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat Sinkhorn'salgorithm, the current state-of-the-art finite dimensional OT solver; (ii) whencomparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density, a semi-discretereformulation of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradientdescent, leading to better performance than approximately solving the problemby discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities, wepropose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space(RKHS). This is currently the only known method to solve this problem, apartfrom computing OT on finite samples. We backup these claims on a set ofdiscrete, semi-discrete and continuous benchmark problems. version:1

Thegoal of this work is to generate better features for transfer learning frommultiple publicly available pre- trained neural networks. To this end, wepropose a novel architecture called Stacked Neural Networks which lever- agesthe fast training time of transfer learning while simul- taneously being muchmore accurate. We show that us- ing a stacked NN architecture can result in upto 8% im- provements in accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques us- ing onlyone pre-trained network for transfer learning. A second aim of this work is tomake network fine- tuning retain the generalizability of the base network toun- seen tasks. To this end, we propose a new technique called "jointfine-tuning" that is able to give accuracies compa- rable to finetuning thesame network individually over two datasets. We also show that a jointlyfinetuned network gen- eralizes better to unseen tasks when compared to anetwork finetuned over a single task. version:1

Imposing sparsity of pixel values andextracting active regions simultaneously greatly complicate the image analysis.We address these challenges by introducing a novel region-selection penalty inthe framework of image-on-scalar regression. Our penalty combines the SmoothlyClipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) regularization, enforcing sparsity, and theSCAD of total variation (TV) regularization, enforcing spatial contiguity, intoone group, which segments contiguous spatial regions against zero-valuedbackground. Efficient algorithm is based on the alternative direction method ofmultipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the non-convex problem into two iterativeoptimization problems with explicit solutions. Another virtue of the proposedmethod is that a divide and conquer learning algorithm is developed, therebyallowing scaling to large images. Several examples are presented and theexperimental results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. version:1

But designing provable algorithmsfor inference has proven to be more challenging. Here we take a first steptowards provable inference in topic models. We leverage a property of topicmodels that enables us to construct simple linear estimators for the unknowntopic proportions that have small variance, and consequently can work withshort documents. Our estimators also correspond to finding an estimate aroundwhich the posterior is well-concentrated. We show lower bounds that for shorterdocuments it can be information theoretically impossible to find the hiddentopics. Finally, we give empirical results that demonstrate that our algorithmworks on realistic topic models. It yields good solutions on synthetic data andruns in time comparable to a {\em single} iteration of Gibbs sampling. version:1

The problem has a longhistory and attracted significant attention for the last decade. However, we donot yet have a complete understanding of the optimal sample complexity of theproblem: The state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity of$O(\sum_{i=2}^{n} \Delta_{i}^{-2}(\ln\delta^{-1} + \ln\ln\Delta_i^{-1}))$($\Delta_{i}$ is the difference between the largest mean and the $i^{th}$mean), while the best known lower bound is $\Omega(\sum_{i=2}^{n}\Delta_{i}^{-2}\ln\delta^{-1})$ for general instances and $\Omega(\Delta^{-2}\ln\ln \Delta^{-1})$ for the two-arm instances. We propose to study theinstance-wise optimality for the BEST-1-ARM problem. Previous work has provedthat it is impossible to have an instance optimal algorithm for the 2-armproblem. However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term$\Omega(\Delta_2^{-2} \ln\ln \Delta_2^{-1})$ (which is an upper bound and worstcase lower bound for the 2-arm problem), there is an instance optimal algorithmfor BEST-1-ARM. Moreover, we introduce a new quantity, called the gap entropyfor a best-arm problem instance, and conjecture that it is the instance-wiselower bound. Hence, resolving this conjecture would provide a final answer tothe old and basic problem. version:1

Gupta, Stefano Ermon category:cs.LG cs.AI  published:2016-05-26 summary:In imitation learning, an agent learns how to behave in an environment withan unknown cost function by mimicking expert demonstrations. Existing imitationlearning algorithms typically involve solving a sequence of planning orreinforcement learning problems. Such algorithms are therefore not directlyapplicable to large, high-dimensional environments, and their performance cansignificantly degrade if the planning problems are not solved to optimality.Under the apprenticeship learning formalism, we develop alternative model-freealgorithms for finding a parameterized stochastic policy that performs at leastas well as an expert policy on an unknown cost function, based on sampletrajectories from the expert. Our approach, based on policy gradients, scalesto large continuous environments with guaranteed convergence to local minima. version:1

It is intended for research scenarios related tosafe human-robot collaboration (SHRC) and interaction (SHRI) in the industrialdomain. The task of human and object modeling has been used for detectingactivity, and for inferring and predicting actions, different from those works,we do human and object modeling in order to learn interactions in RGB-D datafor improving segmentation. For this purpose, we define a novel densityfunction to model a three dimensional (3D) scene in a virtual environment(VREP). This density function takes into account various possibleconfigurations of human-object and object-object relationships and interactionsgoverned by their affordances. Using this function, we synthesize a large,realistic and highly varied synthetic RGB-D dataset that we use for training.We train a random forest classifier, and the pixelwise predictions obtained isintegrated as a unary term in a pairwise conditional random fields (CRF).

Nelson category:cs.LG physics.data-an stat.ML  published:2016-05-26 summary:Performance of nuclear threat detection systems based on gamma-rayspectrometry often strongly depends on the ability to identify the part ofmeasured signal that can be attributed to background radiation. We havesuccessfully applied a method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) toobtain a compact null-space model of background spectra using PCA projectionresiduals to derive a source detection score. We have shown the method'sutility in a threat detection system using mobile spectrometers in urban scenes(Tandon et al 2012). While it is commonly assumed that measured photon countsfollow a Poisson process, standard PCA makes a Gaussian assumption about thedata distribution, which may be a poor approximation when photon counts arelow. This paper studies whether and in what conditions PCA with a Poisson-basedloss function (Poisson PCA) can outperform standard Gaussian PCA in modelingbackground radiation to enable more sensitive and specific nuclear threatdetection. version:1

Cunningham category:q-bio.NC stat.ML  published:2016-05-26 summary:A body of recent work in modeling neural activity focuses on recoveringlow-dimensional latent features that capture the statistical structure oflarge-scale neural populations. Most such approaches have focused on lineargenerative models, where inference is computationally tractable. Here, wepropose fLDS, a general class of nonlinear generative models that permits thefiring rate of each neuron to vary as an arbitrary smooth function of a latent,linear dynamical state. This extra flexibility allows the model to capture aricher set of neural variability than a purely linear model, but retains aneasily visualizable low-dimensional latent space. To fit this class ofnon-conjugate models we propose a variational inference scheme, along with anovel approximate posterior capable of capturing rich temporal correlationsacross time. We show that our techniques permit inference in a wide class ofgenerative models.We also show in application to two neural datasets that,compared to state-of-the-art neural population models, fLDS captures a muchlarger proportion of neural variability with a small number of latentdimensions, providing superior predictive performance and interpretability. version:1

Whenthe function is constrained to have discrete total variation bounded by $C_n$,we derive the minimax optimal (squared) $\ell_2$ estimation error rate,parametrized by $n$ and $C_n$. Total variation denoising, also known as thefused lasso, is seen to be rate optimal. Several simpler estimators exist, suchas Laplacian smoothing and Laplacian eigenmaps. A natural question is: canthese simpler estimators perform just as well? We prove that these estimators,and more broadly all estimators given by linear transformations of the inputdata, are suboptimal over the class of functions with bounded variation. Thisextends fundamental findings of Donoho and Johnstone [1998] on 1-dimensionaltotal variation spaces to higher dimensions. The implication is that thecomputationally simpler methods cannot be used for such sophisticated denoisingtasks, without sacrificing statistical accuracy. We also derive minimax ratesfor discrete Sobolev spaces over $d$-dimensional grids, which are, in somesense, smaller than the total variation function spaces. Indeed, these aresmall enough spaces that linear estimators can be optimal---and a fewwell-known ones are, such as Laplacian smoothing and Laplacian eigenmaps, as weshow. Lastly, we investigate the problem of adaptivity of the total variationdenoiser to these smaller Sobolev function spaces. version:1

We assume we already have a well-trained multi-instancedictionary and its corresponding classifier from the source domain, which canbe used to represent and classify the bags. But it cannot be directly used tothe target domain. Thus we propose to adapt them to the target domain by addingan adaptive term to the source domain classifier. The adaptive function is alinear function based a domain transfer multi-instance dictionary. Given atarget domain bag, we first map it to a bag-level feature space using thedomain transfer dictionary, and then apply a the linear adaptive function toits bag-level feature vector. To learn the domain-transfer dictionary and theadaptive function parameter, we simultaneously minimize the averageclassification error of the target domain classifier over the target domaintraining set, and the complexities of both the adaptive function parameter andthe domain transfer dictionary. The minimization problem is solved by aniterative algorithm which update the dictionary and the function parameteralternately. Experiments over several benchmark data sets show the advantage ofthe proposed method over existing state-of-the-art domain transfermulti-instance learning methods. version:1

They have recently gained prominence inseveral applications that rely on "diverse" subsets. However, theirapplicability to large problems is still limited due to the $\mathcal O(N^3)$complexity of core tasks such as sampling and learning. We enable efficientsampling and learning for DPPs by introducing KronDPP, a DPP model whose kernelmatrix decomposes as a tensor product of multiple smaller kernel matrices. Thisdecomposition immediately enables fast exact sampling. But contrary to what onemay expect, leveraging the Kronecker product structure for speeding up DPPlearning turns out to be more difficult. We overcome this challenge, and derivebatch and stochastic optimization algorithms for efficiently learning theparameters of a KronDPP. version:1

Kakade, Praneeth Netrapalli category:cs.LG math.OC stat.ML  published:2016-05-26 summary:Matrix completion, where we wish to recover a low rank matrix by observing afew entries from it, is a widely studied problem in both theory and practicewith wide applications. Most of the provable algorithms so far on this problemhave been restricted to the offline setting where they provide an estimate ofthe unknown matrix using all observations simultaneously. However, in manyapplications, the online version, where we observe one entry at a time anddynamically update our estimate, is more appealing. While existing algorithmsare efficient for the offline setting, they could be highly inefficient for theonline setting. In this paper, we propose the first provable, efficient online algorithm formatrix completion. Our algorithm starts from an initial estimate of the matrixand then performs non-convex stochastic gradient descent (SGD). After everyobservation, it performs a fast update involving only one row of two tallmatrices, giving near linear total runtime. Our algorithm can be naturally usedin the offline setting as well, where it gives competitive sample complexityand runtime to state of the art algorithms. Our proofs introduce a generalframework to show that SGD updates tend to stay away from saddle surfaces andcould be of broader interests for other non-convex problems to prove tightrates. version:1

However, most existing solutions tomulti-view recognition typically adopt hand-crafted, model-based geometricmethods, which do not readily embrace recent trends in deep learning. Wepropose to bring Convolutional Neural Networks to generic multi-viewrecognition, by decomposing an image sequence into a set of image pairs,classifying each pair independently, and then learning an object classifier byweighting the contribution of each pair. This allows for recognition overarbitrary camera trajectories, without requiring explicit training over thepotentially infinite number of camera paths and lengths. Building thesepairwise relationships then naturally extends to the next-best-view problem inan active recognition framework. To achieve this, we train a secondConvolutional Neural Network to map directly from an observed image to nextviewpoint. Finally, we incorporate this into a trajectory optimisation task,whereby the best recognition confidence is sought for a given trajectorylength.

Our main result gives function-specific lower and upperbounds on the number of stochastic subgradient evaluations needed to optimizeeither the function or its "hardest local alternative" to a given numericalprecision. The bounds are expressed in terms of a localized and computationalanalogue of the modulus of continuity that is central to statistical minimaxanalysis. We show how the computational modulus of continuity can be explicitlycalculated in concrete cases, and relates to the curvature of the function atthe optimum.

To understand the success and limitationsof RNNs, it is critical that we advance our analysis of their fundamentalmemory properties. We focus on echo state networks (ESNs), which are RNNs withsimple memoryless nodes and random connectivity. In most existing analyses, theshort-term memory (STM) capacity results conclude that the ESN network sizemust scale linearly with the input size for unstructured inputs. The maincontribution of this paper is to provide general results characterizing the STMcapacity for linear ESNs with multidimensional input streams when the inputshave common low-dimensional structure: sparsity in a basis or significantstatistical dependence between inputs. In both cases, we show that the numberof nodes in the network must scale linearly with the information rate andpoly-logarithmically with the ambient input dimension. The analysis relies onadvanced applications of random matrix theory and results in explicitnon-asymptotic bounds on the recovery error. Taken together, this analysisprovides a significant step forward in our understanding of the STM propertiesin RNNs. version:1

The problem is enjoying a great interest in computer vision and remotesensing, due to increased computer power and improvement in automated imageunderstanding algorithms. In this paper we address the task of automaticgeolocalization of aerial images from recognition and matching of roads andintersections. Our proposed method is a novel contribution in the literaturethat could enable many applications of aerial image analysis when GPS data isnot available. We offer a complete pipeline for geolocalization, from thedetection of roads and intersections, to the identification of the enclosinggeographic region by matching detected intersections to previously learnedmanually labeled ones, followed by accurate geometric alignment between thedetected roads and the manually labeled maps. We test on a novel dataset withaerial images of two European cities and use the publicly availableOpenStreetMap project for collecting ground truth roads annotations. We show inextensive experiments that our approach produces highly accurate localizationsin the challenging case when we train on images from one city and test on theother and the quality of the aerial images is relatively poor. We also showthat the the alignment between detected roads and pre-stored manual annotationscan be effectively used for improving the quality of the road detectionresults. version:1
arxiv-1605-08313 | A Light-powered, Always-On, Smart Camera with Compressed Domain Gesture Detection | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08313 | author:Anvesha A, Shaojie Xu, Ningyuan Cao, Justin Romberg, Arijit Raychowdhury category:cs.CV  published:2016-05-26 summary:In this paper we propose an energy-e?cient camera-based gesture recognitionsystem powered by light energy for \al- ways on" applications. Low energyconsumption is achieved by directly extracting gesture features from thecompressed measurements, which are the block averages and the linearcombinations of the image sensor's pixel values. The ges- tures are recognizedusing a nearest-neighbour (NN) classi- ?er followed by Dynamic Time Warping(DTW). The sys- tem has been implemented on an Analog Devices Black Fin ULPvision processor and powered by PV cells whose output is regulated by TI'sDC-DC buck converter with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Measured datareveals that with only 400 compressed measurements (768? compression ratio) perframe, the system is able to recognize key wake- up gestures with greater than80% accuracy and only 95mJ of energy per frame. Owing to its fully self-poweredop- eration, the proposed system can ?nd wide applications in \always-on"vision systems such as in surveillance, robotics and consumer electronics withtouch-less operation. version:1

In contrast to existing techniques which arebased on a fine-to-coarse map, we adopt the opposite strategy by prescribing a{\em probabilistic coarse-to-fine} map. This corresponds to a directedprobabilistic model where the coarse variables play the role of latentgenerators of the fine scale (all-atom) data. From an information-theoreticperspective, the framework proposed provides an improvement upon the relativeentropy method that quantifies the uncertainty due to the information loss thatunavoidably takes place during the CG process. Furthermore, it can be readilyextended to a fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties arereflected in the parameters' posterior. The latter can be used to produce notonly point estimates of fine-scale reconstructions or macroscopic observables,but more importantly, predictive posterior distributions on these quantities.These quantify the confidence of the model as a function of the amount of dataand the level of coarse-graining. The issues of model complexity and modelselection are seamlessly addressed by employing a hierarchical prior thatfavors the discovery of sparse solutions, revealing the most prominent featuresin the coarse-grained model. A flexible and parallelizable, Monte Carlo -Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) scheme is proposed for carrying out inferenceand learning tasks. A comparative assessment of the proposed methodology ispresented for a lattice spin system and the SPC/E water model. version:1

Robust techniques are key in real-world applications, as theseoften involve outliers and data corruption. We focus on trimmed versions ofstructurally regularized M-estimators in the high-dimensional setting,including the popular Least Trimmed Squared estimator, as well as analogousestimators for generalized linear models, graphical models, using possiblynon-convex loss functions. We present a general analysis of their statisticalconvergence rates and consistency, and show how to extend any algorithms forM-estimators to fit trimmed variants. We then take a closer look at the$\ell_1$-regularized Least Trimmed Squared estimator as a special case. Ourresults show that this estimator can tolerate a larger fraction of corruptedobservations than state-of-the-art alternatives. The competitive performance ofhigh-dimensional trimmed estimators is illustrated numerically using bothsimulated and real-world genomics data. version:1

Giannakis category:stat.ML cs.IT math.IT math.OC  published:2016-05-26 summary:This paper puts forth a novel algorithm, termed \emph{truncated generalizedgradient flow} (TGGF), to solve for $\bm{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{C}^n$ asystem of $m$ quadratic equations $y_i=\langle\bm{a}_i,\bm{x}\rangle^2$,$i=1,2,\ldots,m$, which even for$\left\{\bm{a}_i\in\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{C}^n\right\}_{i=1}^m$ random is knownto be \emph{NP-hard} in general. We prove that as soon as the number ofequations $m$ is on the order of the number of unknowns $n$, TGGF recovers thesolution exactly (up to a global unimodular constant) with high probability andcomplexity growing linearly with the time required to read the data$\left\{\left(\bm{a}_i;\,y_i\right)\right\}_{i=1}^m$. Specifically, TGGFproceeds in two stages: s1) A novel \emph{orthogonality-promoting}initialization that is obtained with simple power iterations; and, s2) arefinement of the initial estimate by successive updates of scalable\emph{truncated generalized gradient iterations}. The former is in sharpcontrast to the existing spectral initializations, while the latter handles therather challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth \emph{amplitude-based} costfunction. Numerical tests demonstrate that: i) The novelorthogonality-promoting initialization method returns more accurate and robustestimates relative to its spectral counterparts; and ii) even with the sameinitialization, our refinement/truncation outperforms Wirtinger-basedalternatives, all corroborating the superior performance of TGGF overstate-of-the-art algorithms. version:1

Inthis paper, we propose a novel Riemannian extension of the Euclidean stochasticvariance reduced gradient algorithm (R-SVRG) to a compact manifold searchspace. To this end, we show the developments on the Grassmann manifold. The keychallenges of averaging, addition, and subtraction of multiple gradients areaddressed with notions like logarithm mapping and parallel translation ofvectors on the Grassmann manifold. We present a global convergence analysis ofthe proposed algorithm with decay step-sizes and a local convergence rateanalysis under fixed step-size with some natural assumptions. The proposedalgorithm is applied on a number of problems on the Grassmann manifold likeprincipal components analysis, low-rank matrix completion, and the Karcher meancomputation. In all these cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms thestandard Riemannian stochastic gradient descent algorithm. version:2

Rodrigues category:stat.ML cs.LG cs.NE  published:2016-05-26 summary:The generalization error of deep neural networks via their classificationmargin is studied in this work, providing novel generalization error boundsthat are independent of the network depth, thereby avoiding the commonexponential depth-dependency which is unrealistic for current networks withhundreds of layers. We show that a large margin linear classifier operating atthe output of a deep neural network induces a large classification margin atthe input of the network, provided that the network preserves distances indirections normal to the decision boundary. The distance preservation ischaracterized by the average behaviour of the network's Jacobian matrix in theneighbourhood of the training samples. The introduced theory also leads to amargin preservation regularization scheme that outperforms weight decay boththeoretically and empirically. version:1

arxiv-1605-08242 | Neighborhood Sensitive Mapping for Zero-Shot Classification using Independently Learned Semantic Embeddings | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08242 | author:Gaurav Singh, Fabrizio Silvestri, John Shawe-Taylor category:cs.LG  published:2016-05-26 summary:In a traditional setting, classifiers are trained to approximate a targetfunction $f:X \rightarrow Y$ where at least a sample for each $y \in Y$ ispresented to the training algorithm. In a zero-shot setting we have a subset ofthe labels $\hat{Y} \subset Y$ for which we do not observe any correspondingtraining instance. Still, the function $f$ that we train must be able tocorrectly assign labels also on $\hat{Y}$. In practice, zero-shot problems arevery important especially when the label set is large and the cost ofeditorially label samples for all possible values in the label set might beprohibitively high. Most recent approaches to zero-shot learning are based onfinding and exploiting relationships between labels using semantic embeddings.We show in this paper that semantic embeddings, despite being very good atcapturing relationships between labels, are not very good at capturing therelationships among labels in a data-dependent manner. For this reason, wepropose a novel two-step process for learning a zero-shot classifier. In thefirst step, we learn what we call a \emph{property embedding space} capturingthe "\emph{learnable}" features of the label set. Then, we exploit the learnedproperties in order to reduce the generalization error for a linear nearestneighbor-based classifier. version:1

Often, these studies use multivariate pattern recognition methodswith the underlying assumption that the ability to classify the brain signal isequivalent to predict the decision itself. Here we show instead that it ispossible to correctly classify a signal even if it does not contain anypredictive information about the decision. We first define a simple stochasticmodel that mimics the random decision process between two equivalentalternatives, and generate a large number of independent trials that contain nochoice-predictive information. The trials are first time-locked to the timepoint of the final event and then classified using standard machine-learningtechniques. The resulting classification accuracy is above chance level longbefore the time point of time-locking. We then analyze the same trials usinginformation theory. We demonstrate that the high classification accuracy is aconsequence of time-locking and that its time behavior is simply related to thelarge relaxation time of the process. We conclude that when time-locking is acrucial step in the analysis of neuronal activity patterns, both the emergenceand the timing of the classification accuracy are affected by structuralproperties of the network that generates the signal. version:1

More precisely, we use aprobabilistic approach for the problem of recovering sparse stochastic signalsthat are members of the $\ell_p$-balls. In this context, we analyze theBayesian mean-square-error (MSE) for two types of estimators: (i) a linearestimator and (ii) a structured estimator composed of a linear operatorfollowed by a Cartesian product of univariate nonlinear mappings. Byconstruction, the complexity of the proposed nonlinear estimator is comparableto that of its linear counterpart since the nonlinear mapping can beimplemented efficiently in hardware by means of look-up tables (LUTs). Theproposed structure lends itself to neural networks and iterativeshrinkage/thresholding-type algorithms restricted to a single iterate (e.g. dueto imposed hardware or latency constraints). By resorting to an alternatingminimization technique, we obtain a sequence of optimized linear operators andnonlinear mappings that convergence in the objective. The resulting solution isattractive for real-time applications where general iterative and convexoptimization methods are infeasible. version:1

Second, we use our causal direction finder to effectivelydistinguish between features of objects and features of their contexts incollections of static images.

However, both E and M steps are computationally intractable for highdimensional data, while the substitution of one step to a faster surrogate forcombating against intractability can often cause failure in convergence. Wepropose a new learning algorithm which is computationally efficient andprovably ensures convergence to a correct optimum. Its key idea is to run onlya few cycles of Markov Chains (MC) in both E and M steps. Such an idea ofrunning incomplete MC has been well studied only for M step in the literature,called Contrastive Divergence (CD) learning. While such known CD-based schemesfind approximated gradients of the log-likelihood via the mean-field approachin E step, our proposed algorithm does exact ones via MC algorithms in bothsteps due to the multi-time-scale stochastic approximation theory. Despite itstheoretical guarantee in convergence, the proposed scheme might suffer from theslow mixing of MC in E step. To tackle it, we also propose a hybrid approachapplying both mean-field and MC approximation in E step, where the hybridapproach outperforms the bare mean-field CD scheme in our experiments onreal-world datasets. version:1

Inthis paper we consider convex optimization with noisy zero-th orderinformation, that is noisy function evaluations at any desired point. We focuson problems with high degrees of smoothness, such as logistic regression. Weshow that as opposed to gradient-based algorithms, high-order smoothness may beused to improve estimation rates, with a precise dependence of our upper-boundson the degree of smoothness. In particular, we show that for infinitelydifferentiable functions, we recover the same dependence on sample size asgradient-based algorithms, with an extra dimension-dependent factor. This isdone for both convex and strongly-convex functions, with finite horizon andanytime algorithms. Finally, we also recover similar results in the onlineoptimization setting. version:1

The main objective of multiple target tracking is toestimate an unknown number of target trajectories given a sequence ofmeasurements. This quantity of interest is perfectly represented as a set oftrajectories without the need of arbitrary parameters such as labels orordering. We use finite-set statistics to pose this problem in the Bayesianframework and formulate a state space model where the random state is a randomfinite set that contains trajectories. All information of interest is thuscontained in the multitrajectory filtering probability density function (PDF),which represents the multitrajectory PDF of the set of trajectories given themeasurements.

First, they use convolutional neural networkfeatures to build a statistical model for the style of an image. Then theycreate a new image with the content of one image but the style statistics ofanother image. Here, we extend this method to render a movie in a givenartistic style. The naive solution that independently renders each frameproduces poor results because the features of the style move substantially fromone frame to the next. The other naive method that initializes the optimizationfor the next frame using the rendered version of the previous frame alsoproduces poor results because the features of the texture stay fixed relativeto the frame of the movie instead of moving with objects in the scene. The maincontribution of this paper is to use optical flow to initialize the styletransfer optimization so that the texture features move with the objects in thevideo. Finally, we suggest a method to incorporate optical flow explicitly intothe cost function. version:1

Here $nnz(A)$ is the number of nonzeros in $A$, $sr(A)$is the stable rank, $gap$ is the relative eigengap. By separating the $gap$dependence from the $nnz(A)$ term, our first runtime improves upon theclassical power and Lanczos methods. It also improves prior work using fastsubspace embeddings [AC09, CW13] and stochastic optimization [Sha15c], givingsignificantly better dependencies on $sr(A)$ and $\epsilon$. Our second runningtime improves these further when $nnz(A) \le \frac{d*sr(A)}{gap^2}$. Online Eigenvector Estimation: Given a distribution $D$ with covariancematrix $\Sigma$ and a vector $x_0$ which is an $O(gap)$ approximate topeigenvector for $\Sigma$, we show how to refine to an $\epsilon$ approximationusing $ O(\frac{var(D)}{gap*\epsilon})$ samples from $D$. Here $var(D)$ is anatural notion of variance. Combining our algorithm with previous work toinitialize $x_0$, we obtain improved sample complexity and runtime resultsunder a variety of assumptions on $D$. We achieve our results using a general framework that we believe is ofindependent interest.

In this paper, wepresent a weakly supervised approach to automatically obtain spatio-temporalannotations of an actor in action videos. We first obtain a large number ofaction proposals in each video. To capture a few most representative actionproposals in each video and evade processing thousands of them, we rank themusing optical flow and saliency in a 3D-MRF based framework and select a fewproposals using MAP based proposal subset selection method. We demonstrate thatthis ranking preserves the high quality action proposals. Several suchproposals are generated for each video of the same action. Our next challengeis to iteratively select one proposal from each video so that all proposals areglobally consistent. We formulate this as Generalized Maximum Clique Graphproblem using shape, global and fine grained similarity of proposals across thevideos. The output of our method is the most action representative proposalsfrom each video. Our method can also annotate multiple instances of the sameaction in a video. We have validated our approach on three challenging actiondatasets: UCF Sport, sub-JHMDB and THUMOS'13 and have obtained promisingresults compared to several baseline methods. Moreover, on UCF Sports, wedemonstrate that action classifiers trained on these automatically obtainedspatio-temporal annotations have comparable performance to the classifierstrained on ground truth annotation. version:1

Under the classicDawid-Skene model, we establish matching upper and lower bounds with an exactexponent $mI(\pi)$ in which $m$ is the number of workers and $I(\pi)$ theaverage Chernoff information that characterizes the workers' collectiveability. Such an exact characterization of the error exponent allows us tostate a precise sample size requirement$m>\frac{1}{I(\pi)}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ in order to achieve an $\epsilon$misclassification error. In addition, our results imply the optimality ofvarious EM algorithms for crowdsourcing initialized by consistent estimators. version:2

Mahoney category:math.OC cs.LG stat.ML  published:2016-05-26 summary:The celebrated Nesterov's accelerated gradient method offers great speed-upscompared to the classical gradient descend method as it attains the optimalfirst-order oracle complexity for smooth convex optimization. On the otherhand, the popular AdaGrad algorithm competes with mirror descent under the bestregularizer by adaptively scaling the gradient. Recently, it has been shownthat the accelerated gradient descent can be viewed as a linear combination ofgradient descent and mirror descent steps. Here, we draw upon these ideas andpresent a fast linearly-coupled adaptive gradient method (FLAG) as anaccelerated version of AdaGrad, and show that our algorithm can indeed offerthe best of both worlds. Like Nesterov's accelerated algorithm and its proximalvariant, FISTA, our method has a convergence rate of $1/T^2$ after $T$iterations. Like AdaGrad our method adaptively chooses a regularizer, in a waythat performs almost as well as the best choice of regularizer in hindsight. version:1

Here, we explore prediction of future frames in avideo sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about thestructure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network("PredNet") architecture that is inspired by the concept of "predictive coding"from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future framesin a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictionsand only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent networklayers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict themovement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networkslearn internal representations that are useful for decoding latent objectparameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer trainingviews. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural imagestreams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentricmovement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and generalizingacross video datasets. These results suggest that prediction represents apowerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning ofobject and scene structure. version:1

Little category:cs.CV  published:2016-05-25 summary:Commonly used human motion capture systems require intrusive attachment ofmarkers that are visually tracked with multiple cameras. In this work wepresent an efficient and inexpensive solution to markerless motion captureusing only a few Kinect sensors. Unlike the previous work on 3d pose estimationusing a single depth camera, we relax constraints on the camera location and donot assume a co-operative user. We apply recent image segmentation techniquesto depth images and use curriculum learning to train our system on purelysynthetic data. Our method accurately localizes body parts without requiring anexplicit shape model. The body joint locations are then recovered by combiningevidence from multiple views in real-time. We also introduce a dataset of ~6million synthetic depth frames for pose estimation from multiple cameras andexceed state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley MHAD dataset. version:1

Eaves Jr, Patrick Shafto category:cs.AI cs.LG  published:2016-05-25 summary:Machines, not humans, are the world's dominant knowledge accumulators buthumans remain the dominant decision makers. Interpreting and disseminating theknowledge accumulated by machines requires expertise, time, and is prone tofailure. The problem of how best to convey accumulated knowledge from computersto humans is a critical bottleneck in the broader application of machinelearning. We propose an approach based on human teaching where the problem isformalized as selecting a small subset of the data that will, with highprobability, lead the human user to the correct inference. This approach,though successful for modeling human learning in simple laboratory experiments,has failed to achieve broader relevance due to challenges in formulatinggeneral and scalable algorithms. We propose general-purpose teaching viapseudo-marginal sampling and demonstrate the algorithm by teaching topicmodels. Simulation results show our sampling-based approach: effectivelyapproximates the probability where ground-truth is possible via enumeration,results in data that are markedly different from those expected by randomsampling, and speeds learning especially for small amounts of data. Applicationto movie synopsis data illustrates differences between teaching and randomsampling for teaching distributions and specific topics, and demonstrates gainsin scalability and applicability to real-world problems. version:1

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-object tracking andidentification over sets approach to address this challenge. We define jointstates and observations both as finite sets, and develop motion and observationfunctions accordingly. The object identification problem is then formulated andsolved by using expectation-maximization methods. The set formulation enablesus to avoid directly performing observation-to-object association. Weempirically confirm that the overall algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-artin a popular PETS dataset. version:1

In this paper, we study this fundamental tradeoff through aSQRT-Lasso problem for sparse linear regression and sparse precision matrixestimation in high dimensions. We explain how novel optimization techniqueshelp address these computational challenges. Particularly, we propose apathwise iterative smoothing shrinkage thresholding algorithm for solving theSQRT-Lasso optimization problem. We further provide a novel model-basedperspective for analyzing the smoothing optimization framework, which allows usto establish a nearly linear convergence (R-linear convergence) guarantee forour proposed algorithm. This implies that solving the SQRT-Lasso optimizationis almost as easy as solving the Lasso optimization. Moreover, we show that ourproposed algorithm can also be applied to sparse precision matrix estimation,and enjoys good computational properties.

In a Best-Basis instance,we are given $n$ stochastic arms with unknown reward distributions, as well asa matroid $\mathcal{M}$ over the arms. Let the weight of an arm be the mean ofits reward distribution. Our goal is to identify a basis of $\mathcal{M}$ withthe maximum total weight, using as few samples as possible. The problem is a significant generalization of the best arm identificationproblem and the top-$k$ arm identification problem, which have attractedsignificant attentions in recent years. We study both the exact and PACversions of Best-Basis, and provide algorithms with nearly-optimal samplecomplexities for these versions.

They manually define patterns or automatically learn themfrom a large corpus. However, these approaches are limited when grasping thecontext of a sentence, and they fail to capture implicit relations. In thispaper, we address this problem with the following methods. First, we exploitlong short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract higher-level features alongthe shortest dependency paths, connecting headwords of relations and arguments.The path-level features from LSTM networks provide useful clues regardingcontextual information and the validity of arguments. Second, we constructedsamples to train LSTM networks without the need for manual labeling. Inparticular, feedback negative sampling picks highly negative samples amongnon-positive samples through a model trained with positive samples. Theexperimental results show that our approach produces more precise and abundantextractions than state-of-the-art open IE systems. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first work to apply deep learning to Open IE. version:1
arxiv-1605-07906 | How priors of initial hyperparameters affect Gaussian process regression models | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07906 | author:Zexun Chen, Bo Wang category:stat.ML  published:2016-05-25 summary:Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a kernel-based nonparametric method andhas been proved to be effective and powerful. Its performance, however, relieson appropriate selection of kernel and the involving hyperparameters. Thehyperparameters for a specified kernel are often estimated from the data viathe maximum marginal likelihood. Unfortunately, the marginal likelihoodfunctions are not usually convex with respect to the hyperparameters, thereforethe optimization may not converge to global maxima. A common approach to tacklethis issue is to use multiple starting points randomly selected from a specificprior distribution. Therefore, the choice of prior distribution may play avital rule in the usefulness of this approach. In this paper, we study thesensitivity of prior distributions to the hyperparameter estimation and theperformance of GPR. We consider different types of priors, including vague anddata-dominated, for the initial values of hyperparameters for some commonlyused kernels and investigate the influence of the priors on the performance ofGPR models. The results show that the sensitivity of the hyperparameterestimation depends on the choice of kernels, but the priors have littleinfluence on the performance of the GPR models in terms of predictability. version:1

Most of theearly attempts at its solution used manually constructed linguistic andsyntactic rules on small and domain-specific data sets. However, with theadvent of big data, the availability of affordable computing power and therecent popularization of machine learning, the paradigm to tackle this problemhas slowly shifted. Machines are now expected to learn generic causalextraction rules from labelled data with minimal supervision, in a domainindependent-manner. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of causalrelation extraction techniques from both paradigms, and analyse their relativestrengths and weaknesses, with recommendations for future work. version:1

We employrecursive autoencoders to generate tree structures of phrase with embeddings atdifferent levels of granularity (e.g., words, sub-phrases, phrases). Over theseembeddings on the source and target side, we introduce a bidimensionalattention network to learn their interactions encoded in a bidimensionalattention matrix, from which we extract two soft attention weight distributionssimultaneously. The weight distributions enable BattRAE to generate compositivephrase representations via convolution. Based on the learned phraserepresentations, we further use a bilinear neural model, trained via amax-margin method, to measure bilingual semantic similarity. In order toevaluate the effectiveness of BattRAE, we incorporate this semantic similarityas an additional feature into a state-of-the-art SMT system. Extensiveexperiments on NIST Chinese-English test sets show that our model achieves asubstantial improvement of up to 1.82 BLEU points over the baseline. version:1

Theidea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of alearned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis.Determining a proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is crucial for bothprecision and efficiency of the process, while most of the existing dictionarylearning algorithms choose the size quite arbitrarily. In this paper, a novelregularization method called the Grouped Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation(GSCAD) is employed for learning the dictionary. The proposed method cansimultaneously learn a sparse dictionary and select the appropriate dictionarysize. Efficient algorithm is designed based on the alternative direction methodof multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the joint non-convex problem with thenon-convex penalty into two convex optimization problems. Several examples arepresented for image denoising and the experimental results are compared withother state-of-the-art approaches. version:1

In this paper, we propose a variational model to learnthis conditional distribution for neural machine translation: a variationalencoder-decoder model that can be trained end-to-end. Different from thevanilla encoder-decoder model that generates target translations from hiddenrepresentations of source sentences alone, the variational model introduces acontinuous latent variable to explicitly model underlying semantics of sourcesentences and to guide the generation of target translations. In order toperform an efficient posterior inference, we build a neural posteriorapproximator that is conditioned only on the source side. Additionally, weemploy a reparameterization technique to estimate the variational lower boundso as to enable standard stochastic gradient optimization and large-scaletraining for the variational model. Experiments on NIST Chinese-Englishtranslation tasks show that the proposed variational neural machine translationachieves significant improvements over both state-of-the-art statistical andneural machine translation baselines. version:1

Stemming is a common strategy to this end.Among many approaches for stemming, statistical stemming has shown to beeffective in a few number of languages, particularly those highly inflectedones. Common statistical approaches heavily relies on string similarity interms of prefix and suffix matching. In this paper we propose a method that isable to find any popular affix in any position of a word; specifically findinginfixes is a required task in Persian, Arabic, and Malay particularly inirregular formations and is a future challenge in informal texts. The proposedmethod aims at finding a number of transformation rules for expanding a wordwith its inflectional/derivation formations.

In this paper, we propose a new methodfor query translation based on dimension projection of embedded vectors fromthe pseudo-relevant documents in the source language to their equivalents inthe target language. To this end, first we learn low-dimensionalrepresentations of the words in the pseudo-relevant collections separately andthen aim at finding a query-dependent transformation matrix between the vectorsof translation pairs. At the next step, representation of each query term isprojected to the target language and then, after using a softmax function, aquery-dependent translation model is built. Finally, the model is used forquery translation. Our experiments on four CLEF collections in French, Spanish,German, and Persian demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms allcompetitive baselines in language modelling, particularly when it is combinedwith a collection-dependent translation model. version:1

The basic idea is to connect two words (w1 and w2) with the dependencypath (r) between them in the embedding space. Specifically, our methodoptimizes the objective w1 + r = w2 in the low-dimensional space, where themulti-hop dependency paths are treated as a sequence of grammatical relationsand modeled by a recurrent neural network. Then, we design the embeddingfeatures that consider linear context and dependency context information, forthe conditional random field (CRF) based aspect term extraction. Experimentalresults on the SemEval datasets show that, (1) with only embedding features, wecan achieve state-of-the-art results; (2) our embedding method whichincorporates the syntactic information among words yields better performancethan other representative ones in aspect term extraction. version:1

Graham, Amos Storkey category:stat.CO stat.ML  published:2016-05-25 summary:Many generative models can be expressed as a deterministic differentiablefunction $\mathrm{\mathbf{g}}(\boldsymbol{u})$ of random variables$\boldsymbol{u}$ drawn from some simple base density. This framework includesboth deep generative architectures such as Variational Autoencoders andGenerative Adversial Nets, and a large class of dynamical system simulators. Wepresent a method for performing efficient MCMC inference in such models underconditioning constraints on the model output. For some models this offers anasymptotically exact inference method where Approximate Bayesian Computationmight otherwise be employed. We use the intuition that conditional inferencecorresponds to integrating the base density across a manifold corresponding tothe set of $\boldsymbol{u}$ consistent with the conditioning. This motivatesthe use of a constrained variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo which leverages thesmooth geometry of the manifold to coherently move between states satisfyingthe constraint. We validate the method by performing inference tasks in adiverse set of models: parameter inference in a dynamical predator-preysimulation, joint 3D pose and camera model inference from a 2D projection andimage in-painting with a generative model of MNIST digit images. version:1

This isproblematic when there are insufficient training examples for rare classes.This effect is emphasized in compound classes, involving the conjunction ofseveral concepts, such as those appearing in action-recognition datasets. Inthis paper, we propose to address this issue by learning how to utilize commonvisual concepts which are readily available. We detect the presence ofprominent concepts in images and use them to infer the target labels instead ofusing visual features directly, combining tools from vision andnatural-language processing. We validate our method on the recently introducedHICO dataset reaching a mAP of 31.54% and on the Stanford-40 Actions dataset,where the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the art and, combinedwith direct visual features, obtains an accuracy 83.12%.

Inthis paper we study this problem for finite state machines with inputs andoutputs, and in particular for Moore machines. We introduce three algorithmsfor solving this problem: (1) the PTAP algorithm, which transforms a set ofinput-output traces into an incomplete Moore machine and then completes thatmachine with self-loops; (2) the PRPNI algorithm, which uses the well-knownRPNI algorithm for automata learning to learn a product of automata encoding aMoore machine; and (3) the MooreMI algorithm, which directly learns a Mooremachine using PTAP extended with state merging. We prove that MooreMI alwayslearns the right machine when the training set is a characteristic sample,which is generally not true for the other two algorithms. We also compare thealgorithms experimentally in terms of the size of the learned machine andseveral notions of accuracy, introduced in this paper. Finally, we compare withOSTIA, an algorithm that learns a more general class of transducers, and findthat OSTIA generally does not learn a Moore machine, even when fed with acharacteristic sample. version:1

One approach to handling non-stationarity is toremove or minimize it before attempting to analyze the data. In the context ofbrain computer interface (BCI) data analysis this may be done by means ofstationary subspace analysis (SSA). The classic SSA method finds a matrix thatprojects the data onto a stationary subspace by optimizing a cost functionbased on a matrix divergence. In this work we present an alternative method forSSA based on a symmetrized version of this matrix divergence. We show that thisframes the problem in terms of distances between symmetric positive definite(SPD) matrices, suggesting a geometric interpretation of the problem. Stemmingfrom this geometric viewpoint, we introduce and analyze a method which utilizesthe geometry of the SPD matrix manifold and the invariance properties of itsmetrics. Most notably we show that these invariances alleviate the need towhiten the input matrices, a common step in many SSA methods which oftenintroduces errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique inexperiments on both synthesized and real-world data. version:1

Without corruptions, this is the well-known matrix completionproblem. From a statistical standpoint this problem has been recentlywell-studied, and conditions on when recovery is possible (how manyobservations do we need, how many corruptions can we tolerate) viapolynomial-time algorithms is by now understood. This paper presents andanalyzes a non-convex optimization approach that greatly reduces thecomputational complexity of the above problems, compared to the best availablealgorithms. In particular, in the fully observed case, with $r$ denoting rankand $d$ dimension, we reduce the complexity from$\mathcal{O}(r^2d^2\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to$\mathcal{O}(rd^2\log(1/\varepsilon))$ -- a big savings when the rank is big.For the partially observed case, we show the complexity of our algorithm is nomore than $\mathcal{O}(r^4d \log d \log(1/\varepsilon))$. Not only is this thebest-known run-time for a provable algorithm under partial observation, but inthe setting where $r$ is small compared to $d$, it also allows fornear-linear-in-$d$ run-time that can be exploited in the fully-observed case aswell, by simply running our algorithm on a subset of the observations. version:1

Moreover, convergence results based on generic no-regretalgorithms typically use a weaker notion of convergence: the convergence of theaverage plays instead of the actual plays. Some work has been done showing thatwhen using a specific no-regret algorithm, the well-known multiplicativeupdates algorithm, convergence of actual plays to equilibria can be shown andbetter quality of outcomes in terms of the price of anarchy can be reached foratomic congestion games and load balancing games. Are there more cases ofnatural no-regret dynamics that perform well in suitable classes of games interms of convergence and quality of outcomes that the dynamics converge to? We answer this question positively in the bulletin-board model by showingthat when employing the mirror-descent algorithm, a well-known genericno-regret algorithm, the actual plays converge quickly to equilibria innonatomic congestion games. Furthermore, the bandit model considers a probablymore realistic and prevalent setting with only partial information, in which ateach time step each player only knows the cost of her own currently playedstrategy, but not any costs of unplayed strategies. For the class of atomiccongestion games, we propose a family of bandit algorithms based on themirror-descent algorithms previously presented, and show that when each playerindividually adopts such a bandit algorithm, their joint (mixed) strategyprofile quickly converges with implications. version:1

The proposed NonconvEx primal-dual SpliTTing (NESTT)algorithm splits the problem into $N$ subproblems, and utilizes an augmentedLagrangian based primal-dual scheme to solve it in a distributed and stochasticmanner. With a special non-uniform sampling, a version of NESTT achieves$\epsilon$-stationary solution using$\mathcal{O}((\sum_{i=1}^N\sqrt{L_i/N})^2/\epsilon)$ gradient evaluations,which can be up to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ times better than the (proximal) gradientdescent methods. It also achieves Q-linear convergence rate for nonconvex$\ell_1$ penalized quadratic problems with polyhedral constraints. Further, wereveal a fundamental connection between {\it primal-dual} based methods and afew {\it primal only} methods such as IAG/SAG/SAGA. version:1
arxiv-1605-07740 | Improving energy efficiency and classification accuracy of neuromorphic chips by learning binary synaptic crossbars | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07740 | author:Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Jianbin Tang category:cs.NE  published:2016-05-25 summary:Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved human level performance in manyimage analytics tasks but DNNs are mostly deployed to GPU platforms thatconsume a considerable amount of power. Brain-inspired spiking neuromorphicchips consume low power and can be highly parallelized. However, for deployingDNNs to energy efficient neuromorphic chips the incompatibility betweencontinuous neurons and synaptic weights of traditional DNNs, discrete spikingneurons and synapses of neuromorphic chips has to be overcome. Previous workhas achieved this by training a network to learn continuous probabilities anddeployment to a neuromorphic architecture by random sampling theseprobabilities. An ensemble of sampled networks is needed to approximate theperformance of the trained network. In the work presented in this paper, we have extended previous research bydirectly learning binary synaptic crossbars. Results on MNIST show that betterperformance can be achieved with a small network in one time step (92.7%maximum observed accuracy vs 95.98% accuracy in our work). Top results on alarger network are similar to previously published results (99.42% maximumobserved accuracy vs 99.45% accuracy in our work). More importantly, in ourwork a smaller ensemble is needed to achieve similar or better accuracy thanprevious work, which translates into significantly decreased energy consumptionfor both networks. Results of our work are stable since they do not requirerandom sampling. version:1

In this paper we explore a simple neural model, called CommNN,that uses continuous communication for fully cooperative tasks. The modelconsists of multiple agents and the communication between them is learnedalongside their policy. We apply this model to a diverse set of tasks,demonstrating the ability of the agents to learn to communicate amongstthemselves, yielding improved performance over non-communicative agents andbaselines. In some cases, it is possible to interpret the language devised bythe agents, revealing simple but effective strategies for solving the task athand. version:1

Dai, Ian Goodfellow category:stat.ML cs.LG  published:2016-05-25 summary:Adversarial training provides a means of regularizing supervised learningalgorithms while virtual adversarial training is able to extend supervisedlearning algorithms to the semi-supervised setting. However, both methodsrequire making small perturbations to numerous entries of the input vector,which is inappropriate for sparse high-dimensional inputs such as one-hot wordrepresentations. We extend adversarial and virtual adversarial training to thetext domain by applying perturbations to the word embeddings in a recurrentneural network rather than to the original input itself. The proposed methodachieves state of the art results on multiple benchmark semi-supervised andpurely supervised tasks. We provide visualizations and analysis showing thatthe learned word embeddings have improved in quality and that while training,the model is less prone to overfitting. version:1
arxiv-1605-07723 | Data Programming: Creating Large Training Sets, Quickly | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723 | author:Alexander Ratner, Christopher De Sa, Sen Wu, Daniel Selsam, Christopher R√© category:stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG  published:2016-05-25 summary:Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervisedlearning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For someapplications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming andexpensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigmfor the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in whichusers provide a set of labeling functions, which are programs thatheuristically label large subsets of data points, albeit noisily. By viewingthese labeling functions as implicitly describing a generative model for thisnoise, we show that we can recover the parameters of this model to "denoise"the training set. Then, we show how to modify a discriminative loss function tomake it noise-aware. We demonstrate our method over a range of discriminativemodels including logistic regression and LSTMs. We establish theoretically thatwe can recover the parameters of these generative models in a handful ofsettings. Experimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP relation extraction challenge, weshow that data programming would have obtained a winning score, and also showthat applying data programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost6 F1 points over a supervised LSTM baseline (and into second place in thecompetition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that dataprogramming may be an easier way to create machine learning models fornon-experts. version:1

Healthy meal recommendations have thepotential to help individuals prevent or manage conditions such as diabetes andobesity. However, learning people's food preferences and making healthyrecommendations that appeal to their palate is challenging. Existing approacheseither only learn high-level preferences or require a prolonged learningperiod. We propose Yum-me, a personalized healthy meal recommender systemdesigned to meet individuals' health goals, dietary restrictions, andfine-grained food preferences. Marrying ideas from user preference learning andhealthy eating promotion, Yum-me enables a simple and accurate food preferenceprofiling procedure via an image-based online learning framework, and projectsthe learned profile into the domain of healthy food options to find ones thatwill appeal to the user. We present the design and implementation of Yum-me,and further discuss the most critical component of it: FoodDist, astate-of-the-art food image analysis model. We demonstrate FoodDist's superiorperformance through careful benchmarking, and discuss its applicability acrossa wide array of dietary applications. We validate the feasibility andeffectiveness of Yum-me through a 60-person user study, in which Yum-meimproves the recommendation acceptance rate by 42.63% over the traditional foodpreference survey. version:1

Our work is along the line of theWirtinger flow (WF) approach, which solves the problem by minimizing anonconvex loss function via a gradient algorithm and can be shown to convergeto a global optimal point under good initialization. In contrast to the smoothloss function used in WF, we adopt a nonsmooth but lower-order loss function,and design a gradient-like algorithm (referred to as reshaped-WF). We show thatfor random Gaussian measurements, reshaped-WF enjoys geometric convergence to aglobal optimal point as long as the number $m$ of measurements is at the orderof $\mathcal{O}(n)$, where $n$ is the dimension of the unknown$\boldsymbol{x}$. This improves the sample complexity of WF, and achieves thesame sample complexity as truncated-WF but without truncation at gradient step.Furthermore, reshaped-WF costs less computationally than WF, and runs fasternumerically than both WF and truncated-WF. Bypassing higher-order variables inthe loss function and truncations in the gradient loop, analysis of reshaped-WFis substantially simplified. version:1

We propose deep structuredenergy based models (DSEBMs), where the energy function is the output of adeterministic deep neural network with structure. We develop novel modelarchitectures to integrate EBMs with different types of data such as staticdata, sequential data, and spatial data, and apply appropriate modelarchitectures to adapt to the data structure. Our training algorithm is builtupon the recent development of score matching \cite{sm}, which connects an EBMwith a regularized autoencoder, eliminating the need for complicated samplingmethod. Statistically sound decision criterion can be derived for anomalydetection purpose from the perspective of the energy landscape of the datadistribution. We investigate two decision criteria for performing anomalydetection: the energy score and the reconstruction error. Extensive empiricalstudies on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our proposed model consistentlymatches or outperforms all the competing methods. version:1

The resulting deeply fused netenjoys several benefits. First, it is able to learn multi-scale representationsas it enjoys the benefits of more base networks, which could form the samefused network, other than the initial group of base networks. Second, in oursuggested fused net formed by one deep and one shallow base networks, the flowsof the information from the earlier intermediate layer of the deep base networkto the output and from the input to the later intermediate layer of the deepbase network are both improved. Last, the deep and shallow base networks arejointly learnt and can benefit from each other. More interestingly, theessential depth of a fused net composed from a deep base network and a shallowbase network is reduced because the fused net could be composed from a lessdeep base network, and thus training the fused net is less difficult thantraining the initial deep base network. Empirical results demonstrate that ourapproach achieves superior performance over two closely-related methods, ResNetand Highway, and competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-arts. version:1

While early versionsemployed random exploration, recent systems fielded by most of the majormanufacturers have utilized range-based and visual sensors and user-placedbeacons to enable robots to map and localize. However, active range and visualsensing solutions have the disadvantages of being intrusive, expensive, or onlyproviding a 1D scan of the environment, while the requirement for beaconplacement imposes other practical limitations. In this paper we present apassive and potentially cheap vision-based solution to 2D localization at nightthat combines easily obtainable day-time maps with low resolutioncontrast-normalized image matching algorithms, image sequence-based matching intwo-dimensions, place match interpolation and recent advances in conventionallow light camera technology. In a range of experiments over a domestic lawn andin a lounge room, we demonstrate that the proposed approach enables 2Dlocalization at night, and analyse the effect on performance of varyingodometry noise levels, place match interpolation and sequence matching length.Finally we benchmark the new low light camera technology and show how it canenable robust place recognition even in an environment lit only by a moonlesssky, raising the tantalizing possibility of being able to apply allconventional vision algorithms, even in the darkest of nights. version:1
arxiv-1605-07700 | Learning Purposeful Behaviour in the Absence of Rewards | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07700 | author:Marlos C. Machado, Michael Bowling category:cs.LG cs.AI  published:2016-05-25 summary:Artificial intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to achieve goalsin the world. In the reinforcement learning framework, goals are encoded asreward functions that guide agent behaviour, and the sum of observed rewardsprovide a notion of progress. However, some domains have no such reward signal,or have a reward signal so sparse as to appear absent. Without reward feedback,agent behaviour is typically random, often dithering aimlessly and lackingintentionality. In this paper we present an algorithm capable of learningpurposeful behaviour in the absence of rewards. The algorithm proceeds byconstructing temporally extended actions (options), through the identificationof purposes that are "just out of reach" of the agent's current behaviour.These purposes establish intrinsic goals for the agent to learn, ultimatelyresulting in a suite of behaviours that encourage the agent to visit differentparts of the state space. Moreover, the approach is particularly suited forsettings where rewards are very sparse, and such behaviours can help in theexploration of the environment until reward is observed. version:1
arxiv-1605-07699 | Describing Human Aesthetic Perception by Deeply-learned Attributes from Flickr | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07699 | author:L. Zhang category:cs.CV  published:2016-05-25 summary:Many aesthetic models in computer vision suffer from two shortcomings: 1) thelow descriptiveness and interpretability of those hand-crafted aestheticcriteria (i.e., nonindicative of region-level aesthetics), and 2) thedifficulty of engineering aesthetic features adaptively and automaticallytoward different image sets. To remedy these problems, we develop a deeparchitecture to learn aesthetically-relevant visual attributes from Flickr1,which are localized by multiple textual attributes in a weakly-supervisedsetting. More specifically, using a bag-ofwords (BoW) representation of thefrequent Flickr image tags, a sparsity-constrained subspace algorithm discoversa compact set of textual attributes (e.g., landscape and sunset) for eachimage. Then, a weakly-supervised learning algorithm projects the textualattributes at image-level to the highly-responsive image patches atpixel-level. These patches indicate where humans look at appealing regions withrespect to each textual attribute, which are employed to learn the visualattributes. Psychological and anatomical studies have shown that humansperceive visual concepts hierarchically. Hence, we normalize these patches andfeed them into a five-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to mimick thehierarchy of human perceiving the visual attributes. We apply the learned deepfeatures on image retargeting, aesthetics ranking, and retrieval. Bothsubjective and objective experimental results thoroughly demonstrate thecompetitiveness of our approach. version:1

CSL provides acommunication-efficient surrogate to the global likelihood that can be used forlow-dimensional estimation, high-dimensional regularized estimation andBayesian inference. For low-dimensional estimation, CSL provably improves uponthe averaging schemes and facilitates the construction of confidence intervals.For high-dimensional regularized estimation, CSL leads to a minimax optimalestimator with minimal communication cost. For Bayesian inference, CSL can beused to form a communication-efficient quasi-posterior distribution thatconverges to the true posterior. This quasi-posterior procedure significantlyimproves the computational efficiency of MCMC algorithms even in anon-distributed setting. The methods are illustrated through empirical studies. version:1

Many traditional probabilistic methods resort toapproximations in either learning, inference, or even both steps due to theirlarge complexity cost. This leads to algorithms where the learning andinference steps are disjoint, which often degrades algorithm performance. Inthis work, we present a Local Perturb-and-MAP (locPMAP) method, a novelframework for structured prediction based on local optimization over randomlyperturbed potential functions. Unlike most prior methods, our proposed schemedoes not rely on approximations and also unifies the learning and inferencesteps. This allows our approach to outperform other methods on several visiontasks, where structured models are commonly used. Additionally, we demonstratehow to apply our proposed scheme for an end-to-end training of a deepstructured network. Finally, our framework gives a novel interpretation forpseudolikelihood, enabling various powerful extensions, such as the use ofpseudolikelihood under the Bayesian framework. version:1

However these were mostly onconversations related to chit-chat with no clear objective and for whichevaluation is difficult. This paper proposes a set of tasks to test thecapabilities of such systems on goal-oriented dialogs, where goal completionensures a well-defined measure of performance. Built in the context ofrestaurant reservation, our tasks require to manipulate sentences and symbols,in order to properly conduct conversations, issue API calls and use the outputsof such calls. We show that an end-to-end dialog system based on MemoryNetworks can reach promising, yet imperfect, performance and learn to performnon-trivial operations. We confirm those results by comparing our system to ahand-crafted slot-filling baseline on data from the second Dialog StateTracking Challenge (Henderson et al., 2014a). version:1

Yu, Jianbo Shi category:cs.CV  published:2016-05-24 summary:Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutionalnetworks (FCNs). However, the use of large receptive fields and many poolinglayers, cause blurring and low spatial resolution inside the deep layers, whichoften lead to spatially fragmented FCN predictions. In this work, we addressthis problem by introducing Convolutional Random Walk Networks (RWNs) thatcombine the strengths of FCNs and random walk based methods. Our proposed RWNjointly optimizes pixelwise affinity and semantic segmentation learningobjectives, and combines these two sources of information via a novel randomwalk layer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of thenetwork. We show that such a grouping mechanism improves the semanticsegmentation accuracy when applied in the deep low spatial resolution FCNlayers. Our proposed RWN fully integrates pixelwise affinity learning and therandom walk process. This makes it possible to train the whole network in anend-to-end fashion with the standard back-propagation algorithm. Additionally,our RWN needs just 131 additional parameters compared to the state-of-the-artDeepLab network, and yet it produces an improvement of 1.5% according to themean IOU evaluation metric on Pascal SBD dataset. version:1

In real-worldapplications, using explicit user feedback as the reward signal is oftenunreliable and costly to collect. This problem can be mitigated if the user'sintent is known in advance or data is available to pre-train a task successpredictor off-line. In practice neither of these apply for most real worldapplications. Here we propose an on-line learning framework whereby thedialogue policy is jointly trained alongside the reward model via activelearning with a Gaussian process model. This Gaussian process operates on acontinuous space dialogue representation generated in an unsupervised fashionusing a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder. The experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed framework is able to significantly reduce dataannotation costs and mitigate noisy user feedback in dialogue policy learning. version:1

Weintroduce Ada Newton as an adaptive algorithm that uses Newton's method withadaptive sample sizes. The main idea of Ada Newton is to increase the size ofthe training set by a factor larger than one in a way that the minimizationvariable for the current training set is in the local neighborhood of theoptimal argument of the next training set. This allows to exploit the quadraticconvergence property of Newton's method and reach the statistical accuracy ofeach training set with only one iteration of Newton's method. We showtheoretically and empirically that Ada Newton can double the size of thetraining set in each iteration to achieve the statistical accuracy of the fulltraining set with about two passes over the dataset. version:1

Since bounding-box-level ground truth is notavailable, most of the solutions proposed so far are based on an iterativeapproach in which the classifier, obtained in the previous iteration, is usedto predict the objects' positions which are used for training in the currentiteration. However, the errors in these predictions can make the process drift.In this paper we propose a self-paced learning protocol to alleviate thisproblem. The main idea is to iteratively select a subset of samples that aremost likely correct, which are used for training. While similar strategies havebeen recently adopted for SVMs and other classifiers, as far as we know, we arethe first showing that a self-paced approach can be used with deep-net-basedclassifiers. We show results on Pascal VOC and ImageNet, outperforming theprevious state of the art on both datasets and specifically obtaining more than100% relative improvement on ImageNet. version:1

These tools could be used toidentify erroneous CT acquisitions or refine protocols to achieve certainsignal to noise characteristics. This paper investigates blind estimationmethods to determine global signal strength and noise levels in chest CTimages. Methods: We propose novel performance metrics corresponding to theaccuracy of noise and signal estimation. We implement and evaluate the noiseestimation performance of six spatial- and frequency- based methods, derivedfrom conventional image filtering algorithms. Algorithms were tested on patientdata sets from whole-body repeat CT acquisitions performed with a higher andlower dose technique over the same scan region. Results: The proposedperformance metrics can evaluate the relative tradeoff of filter parameters andnoise estimation performance. The proposed automated methods tend tounderestimate CT image noise at low-flux levels. Initial application ofmethodology suggests that anisotropic diffusion and Wavelet-transform basedfilters provide optimal estimates of noise. Furthermore, methodology does notprovide accurate estimates of absolute noise levels, but can provide estimatesof relative change and/or trends in noise levels. version:1

Repeated application of a single expansion rule generates anextremely deep network whose structural layout is precisely a truncatedfractal. Such a network contains interacting subpaths of different lengths, butdoes not include any pass-through connections: every internal signal istransformed by a filter and nonlinearity before being seen by subsequentlayers. This property stands in stark contrast to the current approach ofexplicitly structuring very deep networks so that training is a residuallearning problem. Our experiments demonstrate that residual representation isnot fundamental to the success of extremely deep convolutional neural networks.A fractal design achieves an error rate of 22.85% on CIFAR-100, matching thestate-of-the-art held by residual networks. Fractal networks exhibit intriguing properties beyond their high performance.They can be regarded as a computationally efficient implicit union ofsubnetworks of every depth. We explore consequences for training, touching uponconnection with student-teacher behavior, and, most importantly, demonstratingthe ability to extract high-performance fixed-depth subnetworks. To facilitatethis latter task, we develop drop-path, a natural extension of dropout, toregularize co-adaptation of subpaths in fractal architectures. With suchregularization, fractal networks exhibit an anytime property: shallowsubnetworks provide a quick answer, while deeper subnetworks, with higherlatency, provide a more accurate answer. version:1

However, to scale real-world interaction learning to avariety of scenes and objects, acquiring labeled data becomes increasinglyimpractical. To learn about physical object motion without labels, we developan action-conditioned video prediction model that explicitly models pixelmotion, by predicting a distribution over pixel motion from previous frames.Because our model explicitly predicts motion, it is partially invariant toobject appearance, enabling it to generalize to previously unseen objects. Toexplore video prediction for real-world interactive agents, we also introduce adataset of 50,000 robot interactions involving pushing motions, including atest set with novel objects. In this dataset, accurate prediction of videosconditioned on the robot's future actions amounts to learning a "visualimagination" of different futures based on different courses of action. Ourexperiments show that our proposed method not only produces more accurate videopredictions, but also more accurately predicts object motion, when compared toprior methods. version:2

AGaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to improve the effectiveness of localspectral histogram features. Grouping these features leads to forming a roughinitial over-segmented layer which contains coherent regions of pixels. Theregions are merged by using two proposed functions for calculating the distancebetween two neighboring regions and making decisions about their merging.Extensive experiments are performed on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset toevaluate the performance of our proposed method and compare the results withthe recent state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that ourmethod achieves higher level of accuracy for natural images compared to recentmethods. version:1

This paper introduces stochastic recurrentneural networks which glue a deterministic recurrent neural network and a statespace model together to form a stochastic and sequential neural generativemodel. The clear separation of deterministic and stochastic layers allows astructured variational inference network to track the factorization of themodel's posterior distribution. By retaining both the nonlinear recursivestructure of a recurrent neural network and averaging over the uncertainty in alatent path, like a state space model, we improve the state of the art resultson the Blizzard and TIMIT speech modeling data sets by a large margin, whileachieving comparable performances to competing methods on polyphonic musicmodeling. version:1

Assael, Nando de Freitas, Shimon Whiteson category:cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA  published:2016-05-21 summary:We consider the problem of multiple agents sensing and acting in environmentswith the goal of maximising their shared utility. In these environments, agentsmust learn communication protocols in order to share information that is neededto solve the tasks. By embracing deep neural networks, we are able todemonstrate end-to-end learning of protocols in complex environments inspiredby communication riddles and multi-agent computer vision problems with partialobservability. We propose two approaches for learning in these domains:Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL) and Differentiable Inter-Agent Learning(DIAL). The former uses deep Q-learning, while the latter exploits the factthat, during learning, agents can backpropagate error derivatives through(noisy) communication channels. Hence, this approach uses centralised learningbut decentralised execution. Our experiments introduce new environments forstudying the learning of communication protocols and present a set ofengineering innovations that are essential for success in these domains. version:2

We show that this splitting of training and application arisesnaturally, in the classical setting, from a simple independence requirementwith a physical interpretation of being non-signalling. Thus, two seeminglydifferent definitions of inductive learning happen to coincide. This followsfrom very specific properties of classical information, which break down in thequantum setup. We prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for quantum channels,which shows that in the quantum case, the equivalence holds in the asymptoticsetting (for large number of test instances). This reveals a natural analogybetween classical learning protocols and their quantum counterparts, thusallowing to naturally enquire about standard elements in computational learningtheory, such as structural risk minimization, model and sample complexity. version:1

Our approach is motivated by theobservation that complex syntactic structures and related phenomena, such asnested subordinations and nominal predicates, are not handled well by existingmodels.

arxiv-1605-07511 | A note on privacy preserving iteratively reweighted least squares | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07511 | author:Mijung Park, Max Welling category:cs.CR cs.AI stat.AP stat.ML  published:2016-05-24 summary:Iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) is a widely-used method inmachine learning to estimate the parameters in the generalised linear models.In particular, IRLS for L1 minimisation under the linear model provides aclosed-form solution in each step, which is a simple multiplication between theinverse of the weighted second moment matrix and the weighted first momentvector. When dealing with privacy sensitive data, however, developing a privacypreserving IRLS algorithm faces two challenges. First, due to the inversion ofthe second moment matrix, the usual sensitivity analysis in differentialprivacy incorporating a single datapoint perturbation gets complicated andoften requires unrealistic assumptions. Second, due to its iterative nature, asignificant cumulative privacy loss occurs. However, adding a high level ofnoise to compensate for the privacy loss hinders from getting accurateestimates. Here, we develop a practical algorithm that overcomes thesechallenges and outputs privatised and accurate IRLS solutions. In our method,we analyse the sensitivity of each moments separately and treat the matrixinversion and multiplication as a post-processing step, which simplifies thesensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we apply the {\it{concentrated differentialprivacy}} formalism, a more relaxed version of differential privacy, whichrequires adding a significantly less amount of noise for the same level ofprivacy guarantee, compared to the conventional and advanced compositions ofdifferentially private mechanisms. version:1
arxiv-1605-07498 | Leveraging Over Priors for Boosting Control of Prosthetic Hands | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07498 | author:Valentina Gregori category:cs.LG  published:2016-05-24 summary:The Electromyography (EMG) signal is the electrical activity produced bycells of skeletal muscles in order to provide a movement. The non-invasiveprosthetic hand works with several electrodes, placed on the stump of anamputee, that record this signal. In order to favour the control of prosthesis,the EMG signal is analyzed with algorithms based on machine learning theory todecide the movement that the subject is going to do. In order to obtain asignificant control of the prosthesis and avoid mismatch between desired andperformed movements, a long training period is needed when we use thetraditional algorithm of machine learning (i.e. Support Vector Machines). Anactual challenge in this field concerns the reduction of the time necessary foran amputee to learn how to use the prosthesis. Recently, several algorithmsthat exploit a form of prior knowledge have been proposed. In general, we referto prior knowledge as a past experience available in the form of models. In ourcase an amputee, that attempts to perform some movements with the prosthesis,could use experience from different subjects that are already able to performthose movements. The aim of this work is to verify, with a computationalinvestigation, if for an amputee this kind of previous experience is useful inorder to reduce the training time and boost the prosthetic control.Furthermore, we want to understand if and how the final results change when theprevious knowledge of intact or amputated subjects is used for a new amputee.Our experiments indicate that: (1) the use of experience, from other subjectsalready trained to perform a task, makes us able to reduce the training time ofabout an order of magnitude; (2) it seems that an amputee that tries to learnto use the prosthesis doesn't reach different results when he/she exploitsprevious experience of amputees or intact. version:1

Osborne, Shimon Whiteson category:cs.AI cs.LG  published:2016-05-24 summary:Bayesian optimisation has been successfully applied to a variety ofreinforcement learning problems. However, the traditional approach for learningoptimal policies in simulators does not utilise the opportunity to improvelearning by adjusting certain environment variables - state features that arerandomly determined by the environment in a physical setting but arecontrollable in a simulator. This paper considers the problem of finding anoptimal policy while taking into account the impact of environment variables.We present the alternating optimisation and quadrature algorithm which usesBayesian optimisation and Bayesian quadrature to address such settings and isrobust to the presence of significant rare events, which may not be observableunder random sampling but have a considerable impact on determining the optimalpolicy. Our experimental results show that our approach learns better andfaster than existing methods. version:1

The memory is often addressedin a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training withbackpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable forapplications which require the network to read from extremely large memories.On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based onreinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, weexplore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as ahybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organizedin a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with lesscomputation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier totrain than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose toincorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inferenceprocedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of variousstate-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results onSimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task. version:1

The new results show that recent upper boundsthat either (a) hold with high-probability or (b) depend on the total lossofthe best arm or (c) depend on the quadratic variation of the losses, are closeto tight. Besides this we prove two impossibility results. First, the existenceof a single arm that is optimal in every round cannot improve the regret in theworst case. Second, the regret cannot scale with the effective range of thelosses. In contrast, both results are possible in the full-information setting. version:1

This paper considers a generalization of energy-based modelsin which the probability of a state is proportional to an arbitrary positive,strictly decreasing, and twice differentiable function of the state's energy.The precise shape of the nonlinear map from energies to unnormalizedprobabilities has to be learned from data together with the parameters of theenergy function. As a case study we show that the above generalization of afully visible Boltzmann machine yields an accurate model of neural activity ofretinal ganglion cells. We attribute this success to the model's ability toeasily capture distributions whose probabilities span a large dynamic range, apossible consequence of latent variables that globally couple the system.Similar features have recently been observed in many datasets, suggesting thatour new method has wide applicability. version:1

The method is an online approachbased on motion segmentation, and it operates under dynamic backgrounds causedby a moving camera or moving nuisances. The goal of the method is to detect andsegment the object as soon as it moves. Due to stochastic variability in thevideo and unreliability of the motion signal, several frames are needed toreliably detect the object. The method is designed to detect and segment withminimum delay subject to a constraint on the false alarm rate. The method isderived as a problem of Quickest Change Detection.

While prior work hasfocused on predicting boundaries for observed frames, our work aims atpredicting boundaries of future unobserved frames. This requires our model tolearn about the fate of boundaries and extrapolate motion patterns. Weexperiment on established real-world video segmentation dataset, which providesa testbed for this new task. We show for the first time spatio-temporalboundary extrapolation in this challenging scenario. Furthermore, we showlong-term prediction of boundaries in situations where the motion is governedby the laws of physics. We successfully predict boundaries in a billiardscenario without any assumptions of a strong parametric model or any objectnotion. We argue that our model has with minimalistic model assumptions deriveda notion of 'intuitive physics' that can be applied to novel scenes. version:1

Hamed Hassani, Andreas Krause category:cs.LG cs.AI  published:2016-05-24 summary:We consider the Bayesian active learning and experimental design problem,where the goal is to learn the value of some unknown target variable through asequence of informative, noisy tests. In contrast to prior work, we focus onthe challenging, yet practically relevant setting where test outcomes can beconditionally dependent given the hidden target variable. Under suchassumptions, common heuristics, such as greedily performing tests that maximizethe reduction in uncertainty of the target, often perform poorly. In thispaper, we propose ECED, a novel, computationally efficient active learningalgorithm, and prove strong theoretical guarantees that hold with correlated,noisy tests. Rather than directly optimizing the prediction error, at eachstep, ECED picks the test that maximizes the gain in a surrogate objective,which takes into account the dependencies between tests. Our analysis relies onan information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, andutilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the near-optimal bound. Wedemonstrate strong empirical performance of ECED on two problem instances,including a Bayesian experimental design task intended to distinguish amongeconomic theories of how people make risky decisions, and an active preferencelearning task via pairwise comparisons. version:1

A principled way to do this is the information bottleneck (IB) method,where one seeks a code that maximizes information about a 'relevance' variable,Y, while constraining the information encoded about the original data, X.Unfortunately however, the IB method is computationally demanding when data arehigh-dimensional and/or non-gaussian. Here we propose an approximatevariational scheme for maximizing a lower bound on the IB objective, analogousto variational EM. Using this method, we derive an IB algorithm to recoverfeatures that are both relevant and sparse. Finally, we demonstrate howkernelized versions of the algorithm can be used to address a broad range ofproblems with non-linear relation between X and Y. version:1

In order to improve the qualityof the current EventNet, we conduct the following steps and introduce EventNetversion 1.1: (1) manually verify the correctness of event labels for allvideos; (2) remove the YouTube user bias by limiting the maximum number ofvideos in each event from the same YouTube user as 3; (3) remove the videoswhich are currently not accessible online; (4) remove the video belonging tomultiple event categories. After the above procedure, some events may containonly a small number of videos, and therefore we crawl more videos for thoseevents to ensure every event will contain more than 50 videos. Finally,EventNet version 1.1 contains 67,641 videos, 500 events, and 5,028event-specific concepts. In addition, we train a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model for event classification via fine-tuning AlexNet using EventNetversion 1.1.

Adversarial examples that affect one model often affectanother model, even if the two models have different architectures or weretrained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained toperform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitutemodel, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them toa victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work hasfurther developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to labela synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not evencollect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniquesusing reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the trainingprocedure for the substitute model. We introduce new transferability attacksbetween previously unexplored (substitute, victim) pairs of machine learningmodel classes, most notably SVMs and decision trees. We demonstrate our attackson two commercial machine learning classification systems from Amazon (96.19%misclassification rate) and Google (88.94%) using only 800 queries of thevictim model, thereby showing that existing machine learning approaches are ingeneral vulnerable to systematic black-box attacks regardless of theirstructure. version:1

Despite recent progress in proving various non-convex algorithmsconverge from a good initial point, it remains unclear why random or arbitraryinitialization suffices in practice. We prove that the commonly used non-convexobjective function for matrix completion has no spurious local minima -- alllocal minima must also be global.

Our main technical contribution centers around a noveltraining method, called Multibatch, for similarity learning, i.e., for the taskof generating an invariant "face signature" through training pairs of "same"and "not-same" face images. The Multibatch method first generates signaturesfor a mini-batch of $k$ face images and then constructs an unbiased estimate ofthe full gradient by relying on all $k^2-k$ pairs from the mini-batch. We provethat the variance of the Multibatch estimator is bounded by $O(1/k^2)$, undersome mild conditions. In contrast, the standard gradient estimator that relieson random $k/2$ pairs has a variance of order $1/k$. The smaller variance ofthe Multibatch estimator significantly speeds up the convergence rate ofstochastic gradient descent. Using the Multibatch method we train a deepconvolutional neural network that achieves an accuracy of $98.2\%$ on the LFWbenchmark, while its prediction runtime takes only $30$msec on a single ARMCortex A9 core. Furthermore, the entire training process took only 12 hours ona single Titan X GPU. version:1

We show how our metrics can be usedto evaluate the robustness of deep neural nets with experiments on the MNISTand CIFAR-10 datasets. Our algorithm generates more informative estimates ofrobustness metrics compared to estimates based on existing algorithms.Furthermore, we show how existing approaches to improving robustness "overfit"to adversarial examples generated using a specific algorithm.

arxiv-1605-06892 | Accelerated Stochastic Mirror Descent Algorithms For Composite Non-strongly Convex Optimization | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06892 | author:Le Thi Khanh Hien, Canyi Lu, Huan Xu, Jiashi Feng category:math.OC stat.ML  published:2016-05-23 summary:We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of the average functionconsisting of a large number of smooth convex component functions and a generalconvex function that can be non-differentiable. Although many methods have beenproposed to solve the problem with the assumption that the sum is stronglyconvex, few methods support the non-strongly convex cases. Adding a smallquadratic regularization is the common trick used to tackle non-strongly convexproblems; however, it may worsen certain qualities of solutions or weaken theperformance of the algorithms. Avoiding this trick, we extend the deterministicaccelerated proximal gradient methods of Paul Tseng to randomized versions forsolving the problem without the strongly convex assumption. Our algorithmsachieve the optimal convergence rate $O(\nicefrac{1}{k^2})$. Tuning involvedparameters helps our algorithms get better complexity compared with thedeterministic accelerated proximal gradient methods. We also propose a schemefor non-smooth problem. version:2
arxiv-1605-07254 | Convergence guarantees for kernel-based quadrature rules in misspecified settings | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07254 | author:Motonobu Kanagawa, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur, Kenji Fukumizu category:stat.ML  published:2016-05-24 summary:Kernel-based quadrature rules are powerful tools for numerical integrationwhich yield convergence rates much faster than usual Mote Carlo methods. Theserules are constructed based on the assumption that the integrand has a certaindegree of smoothness, and this assumption is expressed as that the integrandbelongs to a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, inpractice such an assumption can be violated, and no general theory has beenestablished for the convergence in such misspecified cases. In this paper, weprove that kernel quadrature rules can be consistent even when an integranddoes not belong to an assumed RKHS, i.e., when the integrand is less smooththan assumed. We derive convergence rates that depend on the (unknown)smoothness of the integrand, where the degree of smoothness is expressed viapowers of RKHSs or via Sobolev spaces. version:1

Our statistical estimator has a physicalinterpretation in terms of "interaction screening". The estimator is consistentand is efficiently implemented using convex optimization.

These twoproperties, however, contradict with each other. A pooling layer (with stride2) quadruples the receptive field size but reduces the number of predictions to25\%. Some existing methods lead to dense predictions using computations thatare not equivalent to the original model. In this paper, we propose theequivalent convolution (eConv) and equivalent pooling (ePool) layers, leadingto predictions that are both dense and equivalent to the baseline CNN model.Dense prediction models learned using eConv and ePool can transfer the baselineCNN's parameters as a starting point, and can inverse transfer the learnedparameters in a dense model back to the original one, which has both fasttesting speed and high accuracy. The proposed eConv and ePool layers haveachieved higher accuracy than baseline CNN in various tasks, including semanticsegmentation, object localization, image categorization and apparent ageestimation, not only in those tasks requiring dense pixel labeling. version:1

Unfortunately, itsperformance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, which makes ADMM oftenunreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weaknessof ADMM by proposing a method to adaptively tune the penalty parameters toachieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm,inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradientdescent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initialstepsize and problem scaling. version:1

Giannakis category:stat.ML cs.LG  published:2016-05-23 summary:A number of applications in engineering, social sciences, physics, andbiology involve inference over networks. In this context, graph signals arewidely encountered as descriptors of vertex attributes or features ingraph-structured data. Estimating such signals in all vertices given noisyobservations of their values on a subset of vertices has been extensivelyanalyzed in the literature of signal processing on graphs (SPoG). This paperadvocates kernel regression as a framework generalizing popular SPoG modelingand reconstruction and expanding their capabilities. Formulating signalreconstruction as a regression task on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces ofgraph signals permeates benefits from statistical learning, offers freshinsights, and allows for estimators to leverage richer forms of priorinformation than existing alternatives. A number of SPoG notions such asbandlimitedness, graph filters, and the graph Fourier transform are naturallyaccommodated in the kernel framework. Additionally, this paper capitalizes onthe so-called representer theorem to devise simpler versions of existingThikhonov regularized estimators, and offers a novel probabilisticinterpretation of kernel methods on graphs based on graphical models. Motivatedby the challenges of selecting the bandwidth parameter in SPoG estimators orthe kernel map in kernel-based methods, the present paper further proposes twomulti-kernel approaches with complementary strengths. Whereas the first enablesestimation of the unknown bandwidth of bandlimited signals, the second allowsfor efficient graph filter selection. Numerical tests with synthetic as well asreal data demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods relative tostate-of-the-art alternatives. version:1

As such, architectures that fit the structure ofgenomics should be learned not prescribed. Here, we develop a novel searchalgorithm, applicable across domains, that discovers an optimal architecturewhich simultaneously learns general genomic patterns and identifies the mostimportant sequence motifs in predicting functional genomic outcomes.

However, generative models have limited capacity to handle richsensory observations, such as camera images, since they must model the entiredistribution over sensor readings. Discriminative models do not suffer fromthis limitation, but are typically more complex to train as latent variablemodels for state estimation. We present an alternative approach where theparameters of the latent state distribution are directly optimized as adeterministic computation graph, resulting in a simple and effective gradientdescent algorithm for training discriminative state estimators. We show thatthis procedure can be used to train state estimators that use complex input,such as raw camera images, which must be processed using expressive nonlinearfunction approximators such as convolutional neural networks. Our model can beviewed as a type of recurrent neural network, and the connection toprobabilistic filtering allows us to design a network architecture that isparticularly well suited for state estimation. We evaluate our approach ontracking task with raw image inputs. The results show significant improvementover both standard generative approaches and regular recurrent neural networks. version:1

Although variance reduction techniques for optimizingfinite-sum problems have witnessed a huge surge of interest in recent years,all existing work is limited to vector space problems. We introduce\emph{Riemannian SVRG}, a new variance reduced Riemannian optimization method.We analyze this method for both geodesically smooth \emph{convex} and\emph{nonconvex} functions. Our analysis reveals that Riemannian SVRG comeswith advantages of the usual SVRG method, but with factors depending onmanifold curvature that influence its convergence. To the best of ourknowledge, ours is the first \emph{fast} stochastic Riemannian method.Moreover, our work offers the first non-asymptotic complexity analysis fornonconvex Riemannian optimization (even for the batch setting).

However, each fraction of apercent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and sotraining very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing featurereuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems,in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture ofResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decreasedepth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting networkstructures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superiorover their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, wedemonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperformsin accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, includingthousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results onCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN. version:1

However, insights into what fundamentally constitutes\textit{optimal} network parameters remains obscure. Similarly, given whatproperties of data can we hope for a non-linear network to learn is also notwell studied. In order to address these challenges, we take a novel approach byanalysing neural network from a data generating perspective, where we assumehidden layers generate the observed data. This perspective allows us to connectseemingly disparate approaches explored independently in the machine learningcommunity such as batch normalization, Independent Component Analysis,orthogonal weight initialization, etc, as parts of a bigger picture and provideinsights into non-linear networks in terms of properties of parameter and datathat lead to better performance. version:1

Ourfairness definition can be interpreted as demanding that given a pool ofapplicants (say, for college admission or mortgages), a worse applicant isnever favored over a better one, despite a learning algorithm's uncertaintyover the true payoffs. We prove results of two types. First, in the important special case of the classic stochastic banditsproblem (i.e., in which there are no contexts), we provide a provably fairalgorithm based on "chained" confidence intervals, and provide a cumulativeregret bound with a cubic dependence on the number of arms. We further showthat any fair algorithm must have such a dependence. When combined with regretbounds for standard non-fair algorithms such as UCB, this proves a strongseparation between fair and unfair learning, which extends to the generalcontextual case. In the general contextual case, we prove a tight connection between fairnessand the KWIK (Knows What It Knows) learning model: a KWIK algorithm for a classof functions can be transformed into a provably fair contextual banditalgorithm, and conversely any fair contextual bandit algorithm can betransformed into a KWIK learning algorithm. This tight connection allows us toprovide a provably fair algorithm for the linear contextual bandit problem witha polynomial dependence on the dimension, and to show (for a different class offunctions) a worst-case exponential gap in regret between fair and non-fairlearning algorithms version:1

However, frequently usedempirical covariance estimator (and its modifications) is very sensitive tooutliers in the data. As P. J. Huber wrote in 1964, "...This raises a questionwhich could have been asked already by Gauss, but which was, as far as I know,only raised a few years ago (notably by Tukey): what happens if the truedistribution deviates slightly from the assumed normal one? As is now wellknown, the sample mean then may have a catastrophically bad performance..."Motivated by this question, we develop a new estimator of the (element-wise)mean of a random matrix, which includes covariance estimation problem as aspecial case. Assuming that the entries of a matrix possess only finite secondmoment, this new estimator admits sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential concentrationaround the unknown mean in the operator norm. We will explain the key ideasbehind our construction, as well as applications to covariance estimation andmatrix completion problems. version:1

For an expected loss function of a deep nonlinear neural network, weprove the following statements under the independence assumption adopted fromrecent work: 1) the function is non-convex and non-concave, 2) every localminimum is a global minimum, 3) every critical point that is not a globalminimum is a saddle point, and 4) the property of saddle points differs forshallow networks (with three layers) and deeper networks (with more than threelayers). Moreover, we prove that the same four statements hold for deep linearneural networks with any depth, any widths and no unrealistic assumptions. As aresult, we present an instance, for which we can answer to the followingquestion: how difficult to directly train a deep model in theory? It is moredifficult than the classical machine learning models (because of thenon-convexity), but not too difficult (because of the nonexistence of poorlocal minima and the property of the saddle points). We note that even thoughwe have advanced the theoretical foundations of deep learning, there is still agap between theory and practice. version:1

Second, we propose to useautomatically learned category-specific attributes to address the largeappearance variations present in generic instance search.

This suggests thatbiological and artificial neural networks share a fundamental organisingprinciple. We shed light on this principle in the framework of optimal coding.Specifically, we first investigate which properties of a code render it robustto transmission over noisy channels and formally prove that for equientropicchannels an upper bound on the expected minimum decoding error is attained forcodes with maximum marginal entropy. We then show that the pairwise correlationof units in a deep layer of a neural network, that has been trained on anobject recognition task, increases when perturbing the distribution of inputimages, i. e., that the network exhibits properties of an optimally codingsystem. By analogy, this suggests that the layer-wise similarity of featurerepresentations in biological and artificial neural networks is a result ofoptimal coding that enables robust transmission of object information overnoisy channels. Because we find that in equientropic channels the upper boundon the expected minimum decoding error is independent of the class-conditionalentropy, our work further provides a plausible explanation why optimal codescan be learned in unsupervised settings. version:1

We approach the problem of monoculardepth estimation by using a neural network to produce a mid-levelrepresentation that summarizes these cues. This network is trained tocharacterize local scene geometry by predicting, at every image location, depthderivatives of different orders, orientations and scales. However, instead of asingle estimate for each derivative, the network outputs probabilitydistributions that allow it to express confidence about some coefficients, andambiguity about others. Scene depth is then estimated by harmonizing thisovercomplete set of network predictions, using a globalization procedure thatfinds a single consistent depth map that best matches all the local derivativedistributions. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through evaluationon the NYU v2 depth data set. version:1

But it is still costly if each evaluation of theobjective requires training and validating the algorithm being optimized,which, for large datasets, often takes hours, days, or even weeks. Toaccelerate hyperparameter optimization, we propose a generative model for thevalidation error as a function of training set size, which is learned duringthe optimization process and allows exploration of preliminary configurationson small subsets, by extrapolating to the full dataset. We construct a Bayesianoptimization procedure, dubbed FABOLAS, which models loss and training time asa function of dataset size and automatically trades off high information gainabout the global optimum against computational cost. Experiments optimizingsupport vector machines and deep neural networks show that FABOLAS often findshigh-quality solutions 10 to 100 times faster than other state-of-the-artBayesian optimization methods. version:1

We proposeback-propagating one step further---to learn camera sensor designs jointly withnetworks that carry out inference on the images they capture. In this paper, wespecifically consider the design and inference problems in a typical colorcamera---where the sensor is able to measure only one color channel at eachpixel location, and computational inference is required to reconstruct a fullcolor image. We learn the camera sensor's color multiplexing pattern byencoding it as layer whose learnable weights determine which color channel,from among a fixed set, will be measured at each location. These weights arejointly trained with those of a reconstruction network that operates on thecorresponding sensor measurements to produce a full color image. Our networkachieves significant improvements in accuracy over the traditional Bayerpattern used in most color cameras. It automatically learns to employ a sparsecolor measurement approach similar to that of a recent design, and moreover,improves upon that design by learning an optimal layout for these measurements. version:1

Restricted NMFrequires in addition that the column spaces of $M$ and $W$ coincide. Findingthe minimal inner dimension $d$ is known to be NP-hard, both for NMF andrestricted NMF. We show that restricted NMF is closely related to a questionabout the nature of minimal probabilistic automata, posed by Paz in his seminal1971 textbook. We use this connection to answer Paz's question negatively, thusfalsifying a positive answer claimed in 1974. Furthermore, we investigatewhether a rational matrix $M$ always has a restricted NMF of minimal innerdimension whose factors $W$ and $H$ are also rational. We show that this holdsfor matrices $M$ of rank at most $3$ and we exhibit a rank-$4$ matrix for which$W$ and $H$ require irrational entries. version:1

This work aims to distinguish spontaneous(felt) smile expressions from posed (deliberate) smiles by extracting andanalyzing both global (macro) motion of the face and subtle (micro) changes inthe facial expression features through both tracking a series of facialfiducial markers as well as using dense optical flow. Specifically the eyes andlips features are captured and used for analysis. It aims to automaticallyclassify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by usingsupport vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large database showpromising results as compared to other relevant methods. version:1

We show that our model isapplicable to general regression problems, and is particularly well-suited togrid-structured data and problems where the dependence on covariates is closeto being separable. Furthermore, when applied to collaborative filtering, ourmodel provides an effective GP based method that has a low-rank matrixfactorisation at its core, and gives a natural and elegant method forincorporating side information. version:1

Weshow a large gap between the adversarial and the stochastic cases. In theadversarial case, we prove that even for dense feedback graphs, the learnercannot improve upon a trivial regret bound obtained by ignoring any additionalfeedback besides her own loss. In contrast, in the stochastic case we give analgorithm that achieves $\widetilde \Theta(\sqrt{\alpha T})$ regret over $T$rounds, provided that the independence numbers of the hidden feedback graphsare at most $\alpha$. We also extend our results to a more general feedbackmodel, in which the learner does not necessarily observe her own loss, and showthat, even in simple cases, concealing the feedback graphs might render alearnable problem unlearnable. version:1

We follow the Bayesianperspective and use a maximum a posteriori criterion to determine the modelthat best explains each observed patch. In situations where it is not possibleto learn a model from the observed image, e.g. blurred images, this approach,in general, leads to better results in comparison with using only a genericmodel. In particular, when the input image belongs to a class for which we havea pre-computed model, the improvement is more pronounced. version:1
arxiv-1605-06995 | Practical Privacy For Expectation Maximization | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06995 | author:Mijung Park, Jimmy Foulds, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Max Welling category:cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR stat.ME stat.ML  published:2016-05-23 summary:Expectation maximization (EM) is an iterative algorithm that computes maximumlikelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates for models with unobservedvariables. While widely used, the iterative nature of EM presents challengesfor privacy-preserving estimation. Multiple iterations are required to obtainaccurate parameter estimates, yet each iteration increases the amount of noisethat must be added to achieve a reasonable degree of privacy. We propose apractical algorithm that overcomes this challenge and outputs EM parameterestimates that are both accurate and private. Our algorithm focuses on thefrequent use case of models whose joint distribution over observed andunobserved variables remains in the exponential family. For these models, theEM parameters are functions of moments of the data. Our algorithm leveragesthis to preserve privacy by perturbing the moments, for which the amount ofadditive noise scales naturally with the data. In addition, our algorithm usesa relaxed notion of the differential privacy (DP) gold standard, calledconcentrated differential privacy (CDP). Rather than focusing on single-queryloss, CDP provides high probability bounds for cumulative privacy loss, whichis well suited for iterative algorithms. For mixture models, we show that ourmethod requires a significantly smaller privacy budget for the same estimationaccuracy compared to both DP and its (epsilon, delta)-DP relaxation. Ourgeneral approach of moment perturbation equipped with CDP can be readilyextended to many iterative machine learning algorithms, which opens up variousexciting future directions. version:1

We areinterested in interacting subsystems of this form, which we model as asynchronous graph dynamical systems. Specifically, we study the structurelearning problem for dynamical systems coupled via a directed acyclic graph.Unlike established structure learning procedures that find locally maximumposterior probabilities of a network structure containing latent variables, ourwork shows that we can exploit the properties of certain dynamical systems tocompute globally optimal approximations of these distributions. We arrive atthis result by use of time delay embedding theorems.

First, motivated by the relationshipbetween the linear approximation of a nonlinear function in high dimensionalspace and the state of-the-art feature representation used in image retrieval,i.e., VLAD, we propose a new approach for the approximation. The embeddedvectors resulted by the function approximation process are then aggregated toform a single representation for image retrieval. Second, in order to make theproposed embedding method applicable to large scale problem, we further deriveits fast version in which the embedded vectors can be efficiently computed,i.e., in the closed-form. We compare the proposed embedding methods with thestate of the art in the context of image search under various settings: whenthe images are represented by medium length vectors, short vectors, or binaryvectors. The experimental results show that the proposed embedding methodsoutperform existing the state of the art on the standard public image retrievalbenchmarks. version:1

Surprisingly, unlike the smooth case, our knowledge of thisfundamental problem is very limited. For example, it is not known whether theproximal stochastic gradient method with constant minibatch converges to astationary point. To tackle this issue, we develop fast stochastic algorithmsthat provably converge to a stationary point for constant minibatches.Furthermore, using a variant of these algorithms, we show provably fasterconvergence than batch proximal gradient descent. Finally, we prove globallinear convergence rate for an interesting subclass of nonsmooth nonconvexfunctions, that subsumes several recent works.

Due to constraints of partition strategy, existing models maycause unnecessary dissections in sparse regions when fitting data in denseregions. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a parsimonious partitionmodel, named Stochastic Patching Process (SPP), to deal with multi-dimensionalarrays. SPP adopts an "enclosing" strategy to attach rectangular patches todense regions. SPP is self-consistent such that it can be extended to infinitearrays. We apply SPP to relational modeling and the experimental resultsvalidate its merit compared to the state-of-the-arts. version:1

Specifically, for each pixel in a semanticcategory mask, its corresponding instance bounding box is predicted using adeep fully convolutional regression network. Thus it follows a differentpipeline to the popular detect-then-segment approaches that first predictinstances' bounding boxes, which are the current state-of-the-art in instancesegmentation. We show that, by leveraging the strength of our state-of-the-artsemantic segmentation models, the proposed method can achieve comparable oreven better results to detect-then-segment approaches. We make the followingcontributions. (i) First, we propose a simple yet effective approach tosemantic instance segmentation. (ii) Second, we propose an online bootstrappingmethod during training, which is critically important for achieving goodperformance for both semantic category segmentation and instance-levelsegmentation. (iii) As the performance of semantic category segmentation has asignificant impact on the instance-level segmentation, which is the second stepof our approach, we train fully convolutional residual networks to achieve thebest semantic category segmentation accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Mask-CNN model withoutthe fully connected layers for fine-grained recognition. Based on the partannotations of fine-grained images, the proposed model consists of a fullyconvolutional network to both locate the discriminative parts (e.g., head andtorso), and more importantly generate object/part masks for selecting usefuland meaningful convolutional descriptors. After that, a four-stream Mask-CNNmodel is built for aggregating the selected object- and part-level descriptorssimultaneously.

To thisend, we develop a framework to recover the unknown structure without sequencinginformation across video sequences. Our proposed compressed sensing frameworkposes the estimation of 3D structure as the problem of dictionary learning,where the dictionary is defined as an aggregation of the temporally varying 3Dstructures. Given the smooth motion of dynamic objects, we observe any elementin the dictionary can be well approximated by a sparse linear combination ofother elements in the same dictionary (i. e. self-expression). Moreover, thesparse coefficients describing a locally linear 3D structural interpolationreveal the local sequencing information. Our formulation optimizes a biconvexcost function that leverages a compressed sensing formulation and enforces bothstructural dependency coherence across video streams, as well as motionsmoothness across estimates from common video sources. We further analyze thereconstructability of our approach under different capture scenarios, and itscomparison and relation to existing methods. Experimental results on largeamounts of synthetic data as well as real imagery demonstrate the effectivenessof our approach. version:1

These broadcasters arelikely to gain greater attention if their posts can remain visible for a longerperiod of time among their followers' most recent feeds. Then when to post? Inthis paper, we study the problem of smart broadcasting using the framework oftemporal point processes, where we model users feeds and posts as discreteevents occurring in continuous time. Based on such continuous-time model, thenchoosing a broadcasting strategy for a user becomes a problem of designing theconditional intensity of her posting events. We derive a novel formula whichlinks this conditional intensity with the visibility of the user in herfollowers' feeds. Furthermore, by exploiting this formula, we develop anefficient convex optimization framework for the when-to-post problem. Ourmethod can find broadcasting strategies that reach a desired visibility levelwith provable guarantees. We experimented with data gathered from Twitter, andshow that our framework can consistently make broadcasters' post more visiblethan alternatives. version:1

A longstanding openquestion, posed by Cohen and Rothblum in 1993, is whether a rational matrix $M$always has an NMF of minimal inner dimension $d$ whose factors $W$ and $H$ arealso rational.

In the medical domain,especially in the case of rare diseases, revealing causal relationships from agiven data set may lead to improvement of clinical practice, e.g., developmentof treatment and medication. Many causal discovery methods have been introducedin the past decades. A disadvantage of these causal discovery algorithms,however, is the inherent instability in structure estimation. With finite datasamples small changes in the data can lead to completely different optimalstructures. The present work presents a new causal discovery algorithm forlongitudinal data that is robust for finite data samples. The method works asfollows. We model causal models using structural equation models. Models arescored along two objectives: the model fit and the model complexity. Since bothobjectives are often conflicting we use a multi-objective evolutionaryalgorithm to search for Pareto optimal models. To handle the instability ofsmall finite data samples, we repeatedly subsample the data and select thosesubstructures (from optimal models) that are both stable and parsimonious whichare then used to infer a causal model. In order to validate, we compare ourmethod with the state-of-the-art PC algorithm on a simulated data set with theknown ground truth model. Furthermore, we present the results of our discoveryalgorithm on three real-world longitudinal data sets about chronic fatiguesyndrome, Alzheimer disease and chronic kidney disease that have beencorroborated by medical experts and literature. version:1

Tizhoosh, Shahryar Rahnamayan category:cs.CV  published:2016-05-22 summary:It is well-known in image processing that computational cost increasesrapidly with the number and dimensions of the images to be processed. Severalfields, such as medical imaging, routinely use numerous very large images,which might also be 3D and/or captured at several frequency bands, all addingto the computational expense. Multiresolution analysis is a method ofincreasing the efficiency of the segmentation process. One multiresolutionapproach is the coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, whereby the segmentationstarts at a coarse resolution and is then fine-tuned during subsequent steps.The starting resolution for segmentation is generally selected arbitrarily withno clear selection criteria. The research reported in this paper showed thatstarting from different resolutions for image segmentation results in differentaccuracies and computational times, even for images of the same category(depicting similar scenes or objects). An automated method for resolutionselection for an input image would thus be beneficial. This paper introduces aframework for the automated selection of the best resolution for imagesegmentation. We propose a measure for defining the best resolution based onuser/system criteria, offering a trade-off between accuracy and computationtime. A learning approach is then introduced for the selection of theresolution, whereby extracted image features are mapped to the previouslydetermined best resolution. In the learning process, class (i.e., resolution)distribution is generally imbalanced, making effective learning from the datadifficult. Experiments conducted with three datasets using two differentsegmentation algorithms show that the resolutions selected through learningenable much faster segmentation than the original ones, while retaining atleast the original accuracy. version:1

In particular, itis unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and poolingoperations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the abilityof convolutional arithmetic circuits to model correlations among regions oftheir input. Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank,which for a given input partition, measures how far a function is from beingseparable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supportsexponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while beinglimited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's poolinggeometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus servesas a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows ascommonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones,orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Inaddition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support onlylinear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functionsbrought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlationunder favored partitions of the input. version:1

To shorten the recognition time andimprove the recognition of driving styles, a k-means clustering-based supportvector machine ( kMC-SVM) method is developed and used for classifying driversinto two types: aggressive and moderate. First, vehicle speed and throttleopening are treated as the feature parameters to reflect the driving styles.Second, to discriminate driver curve-negotiating behaviors and reduce thenumber of support vectors, the k-means clustering method is used to extract andgather the two types of driving data and shorten the recognition time. Then,based on the clustering results, a support vector machine approach is utilizedto generate the hyperplane for judging and predicting to which types the humandriver are subject. Lastly, to verify the validity of the kMC-SVM method, across-validation experiment is designed and conducted. The research resultsshow that the $ k $MC-SVM is an effective method to classify driving styleswith a short time, compared with SVM method. version:1

Customer demands are satisfied subject to limited plantproduction and limited depot storage capacity. The objective is to determinethe locations of plants and depots in order to minimize the total costincluding the fixed cost and transportation cost. A hybrid evolutionaryalgorithm (HEA) with genetic operations and local search is proposed. To avoidthe expensive calculation of fitness of population in terms of computationaltime, the HEA uses extreme machine learning to approximate the fitness of mostof the individuals. Moreover, two heuristics based on the characteristic of theproblem is incorporated to generate a good initial population. Computational experiments are performed on two sets of test instances fromthe recent literature. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluatedand analyzed. Compared with the state-of-the-art genetic algorithm, theproposed algorithm can find the optimal or near-optimal solutions in areasonable computational time. version:1

The model is designed byintroducing a three-way weight tensor to capture the multiplicativeinteractions between side information and sequences. The proposed model buildson the Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (TSBN), a sequential stack of SigmoidBelief Networks (SBNs). The transition matrices are further factored to reducethe number of parameters and improve generalization. When side information isnot available, a general framework for semi-supervised learning based on theproposed model is constituted, allowing robust sequence classification.Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-artpredictive and classification performance on sequential data, and has thecapacity to synthesize sequences, with controlled style transitioning andblending. version:1

Our purposewas to develop a Java-JINI distributed library that implements GeneticAlgorithms with sub-populations (coarse grain) and a graphical interface inorder to configure and follow the evolution of the search. The sub-populationsare simulated/evaluated in personal computers connected trough a network,keeping in mind different models of sub-populations, migration policies andnetwork topologies. We show that this model delays the convergence of thepopulation keeping a higher level of genetic diversity and allows a muchgreater number of evaluations since they are distributed among severalcomputers compared with the traditional Genetic Algorithms. version:1

Sidiropoulos category:cs.LG  published:2016-05-21 summary:Dimensionality reduction techniques play an essential role in data analytics,signal processing and machine learning. Dimensionality reduction is usuallyperformed in a preprocessing stage that is separate from subsequent dataanalysis, such as clustering or classification. Finding reduced-dimensionrepresentations that are well-suited for the intended task is more appealing.This paper proposes a joint factor analysis and latent clustering framework,which aims at learning cluster-aware low-dimensional representations of matrixand tensor data. The proposed approach leverages matrix and tensorfactorization models that produce essentially unique latent representations ofthe data to unravel latent cluster structure -- which is otherwise obscuredbecause of the freedom to apply an oblique transformation in latent space. Atthe same time, latent cluster structure is used as prior information to enhancethe performance of factorization. Specific contributions include severalcustom-built problem formulations, corresponding algorithms, and discussion ofassociated convergence properties. Besides extensive simulations, real-worlddatasets such as Reuters document data and MNIST image data are also employedto showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. version:1

Thesewaveforms have short duration (less than 100 ms), so the inspection process isusually time-consuming, particularly for ambulatory long term EEG records.Therefore, an automatic detection system of epileptiform discharges can be avaluable tool for a Neurology service. The proposed approach is the developmentof a multi stage detection algorithm, which processes the complete EEG signalsand applies decision criteria to selected waveforms. It employs EEG analysistechniques such as Wavelet Transform and Mimetic Analysis, complemented with aclassification based on Fuzzy Logic. In order to evaluate the algorithm'sperformance, data were collected from several epileptic patients, withepileptiform activity marked by a Neurologist. The average values obtained forboth Sensitivity and Specificity were respectively higher than 80 and 70percent. version:1

Wepropose a simple an effective deeplearning approach that transfers fine-grained knowledge gained from highresolution training data to the coarse low-resolution test scenario. Suchfine-to-coarse knowledge transfer has many real world applications, such asidentifying objects in surveillance photos or satellite images where the imageresolution at the test time is very low but plenty of high resolution photos ofsimilar objects are available.

Mostly, documents are stored as bag-of-words tf-idf representation.One of the most used ways of computing similarity between a pair of documentsis cosine similarity between the vector representations, but cosine similarityis not a metric distance measure as it doesn't follow triangle inequality,therefore most metric searching methods can not be applied directly. We proposean efficient method for indexing documents using a pivot tree that leads toefficient retrieval. We also study the relation between precision andefficiency for the proposed method and compare it with a state of the art inthe area of document searching based on inner product. version:1
arxiv-1605-06673 | Cross Domain Adaptation by Learning Partially Shared Classifiers and Weighting Source Data Points in the Shared Subspaces | http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06673 | author:Hongqi Wang, Anfeng Xu, Shanshan Wang, Sunny Chughtai category:cs.LG  published:2016-05-21 summary:Transfer learning is a problem defined over two domains. These two domainsshare the same feature space and class label space, but have significantlydifferent distributions. One domain has sufficient labels, named as sourcedomain, and the other domain has few labels, named as target do- main. Theproblem is to learn a effective classifier for the target domain. In thispaper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for this problem by learninga partially shared classifier for the target domain, and weighting the sourcedomain data points. We learn some shared subspaces for both the data points ofthe two domains, and a shared classifier in the shared subspaces. We hope thatin the shared subspaces, the distributions of two domain can match each otherwell, and to match the distributions, we weight the source domain data pointswith different weighting factors. Moreover, we adapt the shared classifier toeach domain by learning different adaptation functions. To learn the subspacetransformation matrices, the classifier parameters, and the adaptationparameters, we build a objective function with weighted clas- sificationerrors, parameter regularization, local reconstruction regularization, anddistribution matching. This objective function is minimized by an itera- tivealgorithm. Experiments show its effectiveness over benchmark data sets,including travel destination review data set, face expression data set, spamemail data set, etc. version:1

Some areas inthe input space are easier to classify than others. Features that holdinformation about the "difficulty" of the data may be non-discriminative andare therefore disregarded in the classification process. We propose ameta-learning approach where performance may be improved by post-processing.This improvement is done by establishing a dynamic threshold on thebase-classifier results. Since the base-classifier is treated as a "black box"the method presented can be used on any state of the art classifier in order totry an improve its performance. We focus our attention on how to better controlthe true-positive/false-positive trade-off known as the ROC curve. We proposean algorithm for the derivation of optimal thresholds by redistributing theerror depending on features that hold information about difficulty. Wedemonstrate the resulting benefit on both synthetic and real-life data. version:1

In each round of the GRBP thelearner faces a gambler's ruin problem with two possible actions: a {\emcontinuation action} that moves the learner randomly over the state spacearound the current state; and a {\em terminal action} that moves the learnerdirectly into one of the two terminal states (goal and dead-end state). Thecurrent round ends when a terminal state is reached. We first formulate GRBP asan optimization problem, and prove that the optimal policy is characterized bya simple threshold rule. The problem is solved for infinite time budget. Then,we consider the case when the state transition probabilities are unknown andprovide logarithmic problem specific regret bounds. We also identify acondition under which the learner only incurs finite regret. Numerousapplications including optimal medical treatment assignment can be formulatedas a GRBP, in which the continuation action corresponds to the conservativetreatment and the terminal action corresponds to the surgery. version:1

Poon, Zhourong Chen category:cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG  published:2016-05-21 summary:We propose a novel method for hierarchical topic detection where topics areobtained by clustering documents in multiple ways. Specifically, we modeldocument collections using a class of graphical models called hierarchicallatent tree models (HLTMs). The variables at the bottom level of an HLTM areobserved binary variables that represent the presence/absence of words in adocument. The variables at other levels are discrete latent variables, withthose at the second level representing word co-occurrence patterns and those athigher levels representing co-occurrence of patterns at the level below. Eachlatent variable gives a soft partition of the documents, and document clustersin the partitions are interpreted as topics. Latent variables at high levels ofthe hierarchy capture long-range word co-occurrence patterns and hence givethematically more general topics, while those at low levels of the hierarchycapture short-range word co-occurrence patterns and give thematically morespecific topics. Compared with LDA-based topic models, a key advantage of HLTMsis that they, as graphical models, explicitly model the dependence andindependence structure among topics and words, which is conducive to thediscovery of meaningful topics and topic hierarchies. version:1

However, given that in practice trainingdata is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how toincorporate prior knowledge into a model. Here we consider the case of priorprocedural knowledge such as knowing the overall recursive structure of asequence transduction program or the fact that a program will likely usearithmetic operations on real numbers to solve a task. To this end we present adifferentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth. Through a neuralimplementation of the dual stack machine that underlies Forth, programmers canwrite program sketches with slots that can be filled with learnable behaviour.As the program interpreter is end-to-end differentiable, we can optimize thisbehaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user specifiedobjectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computationgraph. We show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leveragedifferent levels of prior program structure and learn complex transductiontasks such as sequence sorting or addition with substantially less data andbetter generalisation over problem sizes. In addition, we introduce neuralprogram optimisations based on symbolic computation and parallel branching thatlead to significant speed improvements. version:1

Jordan category:cs.LG stat.ML  published:2016-05-21 summary:Deep networks rely on massive amounts of labeled data to learn powerfulmodels. For a target task short of labeled data, transfer learning enablesmodel adaptation from a different source domain. This paper addresses deeptransfer learning under a more general scenario that the joint distributions offeatures and labels may change substantially across domains. Based on thetheory of Hilbert space embedding of distributions, a novel joint distributiondiscrepancy is proposed to directly compare joint distributions across domains,eliminating the need of marginal-conditional factorization. Transfer learningis enabled in deep convolutional networks, where the dataset shifts may lingerin multiple task-specific feature layers and the classifier layer. A set ofjoint adaptation networks are crafted to match the joint distributions of theselayers across domains by minimizing the joint distribution discrepancy, whichcan be trained efficiently using back-propagation. Experiments show that thenew approach yields state of the art results on standard domain adaptationdatasets. version:1

This paper proposes a novel algorithm, decoupled asynchronousproximal stochastic gradient descent (DAP-SGD), to minimize an objectivefunction that is the composite of the average of multiple empirical losses anda regularization term. Unlike the traditional asynchronous proximal stochasticgradient descent (TAP-SGD) in which the master carries much of the computationload, the proposed algorithm off-loads the majority of computation tasks fromthe master to workers, and leaves the master to conduct simple additionoperations. This strategy yields an easy-to-parallelize algorithm, whoseperformance is justified by theoretical convergence analyses. To be specific,DAP-SGD achieves an $O(\log T/T)$ rate when the step-size is diminishing and anergodic $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate when the step-size is constant, where $T$ is thenumber of total iterations. version:1

Tuning of parameters or choosing a completelynew algorithm is often needed to achieve a certain performance level,especially when there is a limitation of the computation source. In this paper,we focus on this problem and propose a framework to adaptively select the"best" algorithm-parameter combination and the computation platform underperformance and cost constraints at design time, and adapt the algorithms atruntime based on real-time inputs. This necessitates developing a mechanism toswitch between different algorithms as the nature of the input video changes.Our proposed algorithm calculates a similarity function between a test videoscenario and each training scenario, where the similarity calculation is basedon learning a manifold of image features that is shared by both the trainingand test datasets. Similarity between training and test dataset indicates thesame algorithm can be applied to both of them and achieve similar performance.We design a cost function with this similarity measure to find the most similartraining scenario to the test data. The "best" algorithm under a given platformis obtained by selecting the algorithm with a specific parameter combinationthat performs the best on the corresponding training data. The proposedframework can be used first offline to choose the platform based on performanceand cost constraints, and then online whereby the "best" algorithm is selectedfor each new incoming video segment for a given platform. In the experiments,we apply our algorithm to the problems of pedestrian detection and tracking.

Our problem combines challenges of partial monitoring,because the learning agent only observes the influenced portion of the network,and combinatorial bandits, because the cardinality of the feasible set isexponential in the maximum number of influencers. We propose a computationallyefficient UCB-like algorithm for solving our problem, IMLinUCB, and analyze iton forests. Our regret bounds are polynomial in all quantities of interest;reflect the structure of the network; and do not depend on inherently largequantities, such as the reciprocal of the minimum probability of beinginfluenced and the cardinality of the action set. To the best of our knowledge,these are the first such results. IMLinUCB permits linear generalization andtherefore is suitable for large-scale problems. We evaluate IMLinUCB on severalsynthetic problems and observe that the regret of IMLinUCB scales as suggestedby our upper bounds. A special form of our problem can be viewed as a linearbandit and we match the regret bounds of LinUCB in this case. version:1

However reaching thisneighborhood is often slow and dominates the computational costs. We exploittwo properties specific to empirical risk minimization problems to accelerateNewton's method, namely, subsampling training data and increasing strongconvexity through regularization. We propose a novel continuation method, wherewe define a family of objectives over increasing sample sizes and withdecreasing regularization strength. Solutions on this path are tracked suchthat the minimizer of the previous objective is guaranteed to be within thequadratic convergence region of the next objective to be optimized. Therebyevery Newton iteration is guaranteed to achieve super-linear contractions withregard to the chosen objective, which becomes a moving target. We provide atheoretical analysis that motivates our algorithm, called DynaNewton, andcharacterizes its speed of convergence.

To address this problem, we describe a probabilistic deductivedatabase, called TensorLog, in which reasoning uses a differentiable process.In TensorLog, each clause in a logical theory is first converted into certaintype of factor graph. Then, for each type of query to the factor graph, themessage-passing steps required to perform belief propagation (BP) are"unrolled" into a function, which is differentiable. We show that thesefunctions can be composed recursively to perform inference in non-triviallogical theories containing multiple interrelated clauses and predicates. Bothcompilation and inference in TensorLog are efficient: compilation is linear intheory size and proof depth, and inference is linear in database size and thenumber of message-passing steps used in BP. We also present experimentalresults with TensorLog and discuss its relationship to other first-orderprobabilistic logics. version:1
