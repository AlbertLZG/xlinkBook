Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.</i>This is a survey course designed to provide a broad, forward-facing overview of contemporary health informatics, a specialized field of computing that seeks to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. To understand health informatics (HIT) you also need to have at least a basic understanding of the complex and highly regulated US healthcare industry. The course is designed for students from diverse backgrounds and who have not been previously exposed to HIT. It is divided into three sections:The US healthcare delivery and the key role of the federal government in promoting HIT adoptionThe core technologies that drive all contemporary HIT systems and toolsThe real world applications of HIT from electronic medical and personal health records to exploiting digital data aggregated from them for research and other purposes
ud436 | Computer Networking - Security and Software Defined Networking | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud436 | available:yes level:intermediate instructors:Nick Feamster  description:<i>This class is offered as CS6250 at Georgia Tech where it is a part of the [Online Masters Degree (OMS)](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/). Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.</i>This course covers advanced topics in Computer Networking such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Data Center Networking and Content Distribution. The course is divided into three parts:Part 1 is about the implementation, design principles and goals of a Computer Network and touches upon the various routing algorithms used in CN (such as link-state and distance vector). Part 2 talks about resource control and content distribution in Networking Applications. It covers Congestion Control and Traffic Shaping.Part 3 deals with the operations and management of computer networks encompassing SDN's (Software Defined Networks), Traffic Engineering and Network Security.
ud805 | Software Development Process - From Idea to Product | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud805 | available:yes level:intermediate instructors:Alex Orso  description:<i>This class is offered as CS6330 at Georgia Tech where it is a part of the [Online Masters Degree (OMS)](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/). Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.</i>In SDP, you will learn how to select and implement the ideal software process for your development project. Through Professor Orso's engaging examples and interviews with industry insiders, you will learn both conceptual and practical aspects of software engineering. The course covers requirements engineering, architecture and design, testing and maintenance, and software quality in general. The goal of this class is to equip you with the skills necessary to define requirements, set up an integrated development environment (IDE), learn Git (and Github!) and use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design and build an Android application. We will also examine several testing practices and refactoring techniques that are helpful before the launch of your software project. While everyone working with software should have these skills, they are particularly important for Software Engineers and Engineering Managers.
