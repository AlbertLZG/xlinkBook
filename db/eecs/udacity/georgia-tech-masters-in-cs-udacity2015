ud675 | Machine Learning: Supervised Learning - Predict Housing Prices | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud675 | available:no level:intermediate instructors:Charles Isbell Michael Littman project:Predict Housing Prices  description:*This is the first course in the 3-course Machine Learning Series and is offered at Georgia Tech as CS7641.* *Please note that this is first course is different in structure compared to most Udacity CS courses. There is a final project at the end of the course, and there are no programming quizzes throughout this course.*This course covers Supervised Learning, a machine learning task that makes it possible for your phone to recognize your voice, your email to filter spam, and for computers to learn a bunch of other cool stuff. Supervised Learning is an important component of all kinds of technologies, from stopping credit card fraud, to finding faces in camera images, to recognizing spoken language. Our goal is to give you the skills that you need to understand these technologies and interpret their output, which is important for solving a range of data science problems. And for surviving a robot uprising. **Series Information**: Machine Learning is a graduate-level series of 3 courses, covering the area of Artificial Intelligence concerned with computer programs that modify and improve their performance through experiences. - [Machine Learning 1: Supervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud675) (this course)- [Machine Learning 2: Unsupervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud741)- [Machine Learning 3: Reinforcement Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud820)If you are new to Machine Learning, we suggest you take these 3 courses in order. The entire series is taught as a lively and rigorous dialogue between two eminent Machine Learning professors and friends: Professor Charles Isbell (Georgia Tech) and Professor Michael Littman (Brown University).
ud820 | Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning - Design Learning Agents for Pacman | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud820 | available:no level:intermediate instructors:Charles Isbell Michael Littman project:Design Learning Agents for Pacman  description:*This is the third and final course of the 3-course Machine Learning Series and is offered at Georgia Tech as CS7641. Taking this class here does not earn Georgia Tech credit.*Can we program machines to learn like humans? This Reinforcement Learning course will teach you the algorithms for designing self-learning agents like us! Reinforcement Learning is the area of Machine Learning concerned with the actions that software agents *ought* to take in a particular environment in order to maximize rewards. You can apply Reinforcement Learning to robot control, chess, backgammon, checkers, and other activities that a software agent can learn. Reinforcement Learning uses behaviorist psychology in order to achieve reward maximization.This course includes important Reinforcement Learning approaches like Markov Decision Processes and Game Theory.

Taking this class here does not earn Georgia Tech credit.*Ever wonder how Netflix can predict what movies you'll like? Or how Amazon knows what you want to buy before you do? The answer can be found in Unsupervised Learning!Closely related to pattern recognition, Unsupervised Learning is about analyzing data and looking for patterns. It is an extremely powerful tool for identifying structure in data. This course focuses on how you can use Unsupervised Learning approaches -- including randomized optimization, clustering, and feature selection and transformation -- to find structure in unlabeled data. **Series Information**: Machine Learning is a graduate-level series of 3 courses, covering the area of Artificial Intelligence concerned with computer programs that modify and improve their performance through experiences. - [Machine Learning 1: Supervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud675) - [Machine Learning 2: Unsupervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud741) (this course)- [Machine Learning 3: Reinforcement Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud820)If you are new to Machine Learning, we suggest you take these 3 courses in order.

ud436 | Computer Networking - Buffer Sizing | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud436 | available:no level:intermediate instructors:Nick Feamster project:Buffer Sizing  description:<i>Computer Networking is a part of the Georgia Tech Online Masters Degree. Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.</i>This course covers advanced topics in Computer Networking such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Data Center Networking and Content Distribution. The course is divided into three parts:Part 1 is about the implementation, design principles and goals of a Computer Network and touches upon the various routing algorithms used in CN (such as link-state and distance vector). Part 2 talks about resource control and content distribution in Networking Applications. It covers Congestion Control and Traffic Shaping.Part 3 deals with the operations and management of computer networks encompassing SDN's (Software Defined Networks), Traffic Engineering and Network Security.
ud805 | Software Development Life Cycles - Decision Assistance Android App | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud805 | available:no level:intermediate instructors:Alex Orso project:Decision Assistance Android App  description:In SDLC, you will learn how to select and implement the ideal software process for your development project. Through Professor Orso's engaging examples and interviews with industry insiders, you will learn both conceptual and practical aspects of software engineering. The course covers requirements engineering, architecture and design, testing and maintenance, and software quality in general. The goal of this class is to equip you with the skills necessary to define requirements, set up an integrated development environment (IDE), learn Git (and Github!) and use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design and build an Android application. We will also examine several testing practices and refactoring techniques that are helpful before the launch of your software project. While everyone working with software should have these skills, they are particularly important for Software Engineers and Engineering Managers.<i>SDLC is offered as Software Development Processes at Georgia Tech where it is a part of the Online Masters Degree (OMS). Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.</i>
