Over IAP, students attend a weeklong Team Training Camp of experiential learning modules - led by MIT faculty with the help of MIT alums and other senior professionals in business, engineering, and science where students participate in creative simulations, team problem-solving challenges, and oral presentations, and practice networking with employers. Enrollment limited.
