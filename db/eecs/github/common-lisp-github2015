1029-220 | lisp-koans | https://github.com/google/lisp-koans | author:google description:Common Lisp Koans is a language learning exercise in the same vein as the ruby koans, python koans and others.   It is a port of the prior koans with some modifications to highlight lisp-specific features.  Structured as ordered groups of broken unit tests, the project guides the learner progressively through many Common Lisp language features.  (stars:1029 forks:220 watchers:1029)
