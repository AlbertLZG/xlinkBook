923-189 | lisp-koans | https://github.com/google/lisp-koans | Common Lisp Koans is a language learning exercise in the same vein as the ruby koans, python koans and others.   It is a port of the prior koans with some modifications to highlight lisp-specific features.  Structured as ordered groups of broken unit tests, the project guides the learner progressively through many Common Lisp language features.  (author:google stars:923 forks:189 watchers:923)
