In this course we give an introduction to some of these frameworks, including utility theory, decision analysis, game theory, and Markov decision processes.  We also discuss why people sometimes make seemingly reasonable, yet irrational, decisions.  We begin the class by presenting some of the basics of probability theory, which serves as the main mathematical foundation for the decision making frameworks we will subsequently present.  Although we provide a mathematical/computational basis for the decision making frameworks we examine, we also seek to give intuitive (and sometime counterintuitive) explanations for actual decision making behavior through in-class demonstrations.  No prior experience with probability theory is needed (we¿ll cover what you need to know in class), but students should be comfortable with mathematical manipulation at the level of Math 41.
