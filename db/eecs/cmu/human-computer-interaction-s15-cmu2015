HCI-05391 | Designing Human Centered Software | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05391&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:Why are things so hard to use these days? Why doesn't this thing I just bought work? Why is this web site so hard to use? These are frustrations that we have all faced from systems not designed with people in mind.    The question this course will focus on is: how can we design human-centered systems that people find useful and usable? This course is an introduction to designing, prototyping, and evaluating user interfaces. If you take only one course in Human-Computer Interaction, this is the course for you.    This class is open to all undergrads and grad students, with either technical or non-technical backgrounds. We will cover theory as well as practical application of ideas from Human-Computer Interaction. Course work includes lectures, class discussion, homework, class presentations, and group project.
HCI-05395 | Applications of Cognitive Science | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05395&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.

Students will learn how to use programming languages, how to design and implement effective GUIs, and how to perform user tests. We will cover several prototyping tools and require prototypes to be constructed in each, ranging from animated mock-ups to fully functional programs. The course will also cover usability testing of interactive prototypes. Assignments will require implementing UIs, testing that interface with users, and then modifying the interface based on your findings. Some class sessions will feature design reviews where students present their findings and modifications based on user tests.    This course is for HCII Masters students with a minimal programming background, and for HCI undergrads who have had an introductory programming course. Students taking this course will often not be professional programmers, but will probably need to interact with programmers, and need to:     * Learn to express yourself in executable form     * Learn the basics of what is hard and easy to rapidly prototype     * Learn the basic terminology and approaches used by programmers     * Experience the frustration and joy of programming a working prototype     * Design and conduct informal user tests    PREREQUISITES:  Proficiency in a programming language, program structure, algorithm analysis, and data abstraction. Normally met through an introductory programming course using C, C++, Pascal or Java, such as 15100, 15112, 15127 or equivalent. Pragmatically, students entering this course should be able to independently and successfully write a 300-line program in a 48 hour period.

The student and the Program Director will jointly determine the choice of 05-630 or 05-631, based upon the student's previous programming experience.
HCI-05650 | Interaction Design Studio | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05650&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:An interface is the link between a person and a designed object. The interface communicates how that object is to be used, and how it creates an experience for its user. Interaction design is the process of creating interfaces that define the behavior of the designed object, encompassing both usability and aesthetic dimensions of the artifact. In this course, we will explore issues that pertain to the design of visual, multimodal and tangible interfaces. The class will focus on elements of the larger interaction design process including basic design principles, information architecture and navigation, planning and brainstorming methods, and techniques for developing rapid sketches and prototypes.   Course requirements: Interaction Design Fundamentals (05651)or equivalent course work is a required pre-requisite for this course. Students are expected to have prior experience using a variety of design and programming tools. Please speak with the instructor if you have questions regarding these prerequisites. Note: Students outside of HCII can sign up on the waitlist for this class, in the event that seats become available.
HCI-05671 | HCI Project | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05671&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:The MHCI Project course is an 8-month long capstone project for the Master's of HCI program and integrates everything the students have learned in their coursework into one "end-to-end" experience. Students work in interdisciplinary teams with an industry sponsor to produce a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of a novel service or product idea. The students come from a variety of backgrounds including Computer Science, Psychology, Design, and other related programs. This year students from the Tepper School of Business will participate on teams during the Spring semester, to help develop business plans for the projects. The industrial client defines the project area and guides its direction. In the first few months of the project (January to April), students conduct user research and brainstorm product ideas. The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design. They do weekly iteration cycles, so by the end of the summer, product prototypes are well refined and adapted to user needs. The end goal is a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of the product idea.

They will also read about existing educational games and discuss game design, instructional design, learning and transfer, and the educational effectiveness of digital games. They will analyze an educational game and present their analysis to the class.  The intended audience includes graduate and advanced undergraduate students in HCII, CS, ETC, Design, and students interested in education or psychology research.   To be eligible to enroll, students must have successfully completed one course in human-computer interaction, game design, computer science, or cognitive/educational psychology, or they must have instructor permission.  During most weeks, we will have a lecture and a course meeting devoted to student game presentations, discussion of homework assignments, and hands-on work. The lecture meetings will be devoted to discussions focused on the course readings. The hands-on part will be opportunities for students to work on assignments and projects, and to discuss progress and open issues with the course instructors.
HCI-05833 | Gadgets, Sensors and Activity Recognition in HCI | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05833&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:Recent advances in HCI have been driven by new capabilities to deliver inexpensive devices to users, to display information in mobile and other contexts, to sense the user and their environment, and use these sensors to create models of a user's context and actions.  This course will consider both concepts surrounding these new technological opportunities   through discussion of current literature - and practical considerations  the skills needed to actually build devices.    About 1/3 of this class will review current advances in this area.  The remainder will be devoted to development of individual skills so that students leaving the class will have an ability to actually build small devices for human interaction (in short: "HCI gadgets"). In particular, the course will concentrate on the basics of building simple microcontroller-based devices and will also provide very basic coverage of the machine learning techniques needed for simple sensor-driven statistical models.    The course is designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds including both technically-oriented and non-technical students (especially Designers) interested in HCI. The class will be project oriented with 4-5 electronic prototype building projects during the semester. At least two of these projects will be self-defined in nature and can be adapted to the existing skills and interests of each student.    There are no formal prerequisites for this class. However, the class will involve programming and debugging of micro-controllers. Some coverage of the language used to do this will be provided, and if required by your background, the programming component of the projects can be made comparatively small (but, in that case some other aspect of the projects will need to be expanded). However, you should not take this course if you have no programming background. This course assumes no  background in electronics.
