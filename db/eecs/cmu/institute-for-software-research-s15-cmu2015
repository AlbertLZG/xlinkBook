ISR-08200 | Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=08200&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:Should autonomous robots make life and death decisions on their own?  Should we allow them to select a target and launch weapons? To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around?  Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go?  Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons?  Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe?  As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used.  This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us.  We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates.  Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking.  The course will enhance students' ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments.
ISR-08534 | Usable Privacy Security | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=08534&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:There is growing recognition that technology alone will not provide all of the solutions to security and privacy problems. Human factors play an important role in these areas, and it is important for security and privacy experts to have an understanding of how people will interact with the systems they develop. This course is designed to introduce students to a variety of usability and user interface problems related to privacy and security and to give them experience in designing studies aimed at helping to evaluate usability issues in security and privacy systems. The course is suitable both for students interested in privacy and security who would like to learn more about usability, as well as for students interested in usability who would like to learn more about security and privacy. Much of the course will be taught in a graduate seminar style in which all students will be expected to do a weekly reading assignment and each week different students will prepare a presentation for the class. Students will also work on a group project throughout the semester. The course is open to all graduate students who have technical backgrounds. The 12-unit course numbers (08-734 and 5-836) are for PhD students and masters students. Students enrolled in these course numbers will be expected to play a leadership role in a group project that produces a paper suitable for publication.  The 9-unit 500-level course numbers (08-534 and 05-436) are for juniors, seniors, and masters students. Students enrolled in these course numbers will have less demanding project and presentation requirements.
ISR-08540 | Green Computing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=08540&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:Energy is a key societal resource. However, our energy usage is rising at an alarming rate and therefore it has become critical to manage its consumption more efficiently for long term sustainability. This course introduces students to the exciting area of "Green Computing", and is organizationally divided into two tracks. The first track is "Energy-Efficient Computing", which considers the state of the art techniques for improving the energy efficiency of mobile devices, to laptop and desktop class computers and finally to data centers. We will cover energy efficiency across the hardware/software stack, starting from the individual components like processors and radio interfaces to system level architectures and optimizations. The second track is "Applying Computing towards Sustainability", covering topics that leverage computing to reduce the energy footprint of our society. In particular, we will focus on Smart Buildings and the Smart Grid, covering topics such as sensing, modeling and controlling the energy usage of buildings, new operating systems or software stacks for the smart infrastructure, as well as the privacy and security issues with the new "internet of things". The goal of this course is to help students acquire some of the knowledge and the skills needed to do research in this space of "Green Computing".  Although the course is listed within SCS, it should be of interest to students in several departments, including ECE, MechE, CEE, EPP and Architecture.
ISR-08541 | Hardware and Software Systems for Smart Homes and Buildings: Hardware &amp;  Software Systems For Smart Homes &amp; BuildingsThis Section Cancelled | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=08541&SEMESTER=S15 | Description:Smart automation in the home and buildings hold tremendous promise to enhance the quality of our lives and improving energy efficiency. In this course we will take a hand on approach towards building hardware and software systems within the context of these emerging smart homes and smart building domains. You will learn about embedded systems and how to choose the appropriate one for different smart home projects, including understanding the advantages and limitations of such platforms. You will learn about sensors and how to interface them with the real world to be able to get useful and actionable data. You will learn about designing systems from ground up, including schematic and PCB layouts. You will learn about different radio technologies, so that you can build a network of sensors that can communicate with each other. You will also learn about storing the sensor data for visualization, analysis and presentation both locally and to the cloud. The course will comprise of hands on exercises, which build upon each other as the course progresses through the semester. We will likely use an embedded platform such as the Rasberry PI or the BeagleBone Black (cost between $75 and $100) and each student will be expected to buy one of these platforms to use throughout the semester. From time to time we will also discuss latest research papers and case studies on topics related to smart home and buildings, with the focus towards deployed systems. The course grade will be computed based on the homework and mini-project assignments, class presentations and a semester long course project. It is expected that students will have some programming background, are excited to take on hands on projects, and want to learn how to build end to end systems for smart homes. As a side effect, perhaps some of your ideas will lead to the next NEST (sold for $3.2B in 2014!).

The explosion in smart phone ownership along with the deployment of 4G networks is leading to a slew of new mobile apps and services. They range from mobile commerce services to wireless enterprise apps and mobile social networking apps, all the way to more futuristic pervasive computing scenarios where phones interact with a number of other everyday objects (e.g. smart homes, smart cars, smart glasses, health/fitness sensors).  These apps and services are emerging as part of an increasingly rich ecosystem where context awareness and intelligent predictive technologies are used to offer increasingly personalized experiences to users. This same ecosystem has emerged as the engine behind increasingly targeted marketing and advertising scenarios that also raise challenging privacy issues.  The course objective is to introduce participants to the technologies, services and business models associated with Mobile and Pervasive Commerce. It also provides an overview of future trends and ongoing research.  You will learn to evaluate critical design tradeoffs associated with different mobile technologies, architectures, interfaces and business models and how they impact the usability, security, privacy and commercial viability of mobile and pervasive computing services and apps. Topics include Mobile Communications, Mobile OS, Mobile Web technologies � including app development, Mobile Security, Mobile Payments, Mobile Web Apps and Services (e.g. Mobile Entertainment, Mobile Banking, Mobile, Mobile Social Networking, Mobile Health, etc.), Location-Based Services, RFID, Mobile Enterprise Apps, Pervasive Computing Applications, Context awareness, intelligent assistant technologies, and privacy.
