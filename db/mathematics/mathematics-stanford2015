MATH263B | Modular Representation Theory | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=MATH263B | Instructors: ; Bump, D. (PI) description:Modular representation theory, a field largely created by Brauer, is the representation theory of finite groups over a field of characteristic p. It was a key tool in the classification of finite simple groups. Key features are the important roles played by projective modules, and the subtle relationship with the characteristic zero theory. Modular representation theory has strong similarities to the theory of groups of Lie type, with normalizers of p-subgroups playing the role of parabolics. Brauer and Green found deep relationships between the modular representation theory of the group and the simpler representation theory of such subgroups. In addition to such classical topics, we will look at some more recent developments.
