STATS333 | Modern Spectral Analysis | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=STATS333 | instructors:Chui, C. (PI); Donoho, D. (PI) description:Traditional spectral analysis encompassed Fourier methods and their elaborations, under the assumption of a simple superposition of sinusoids, independent of time. This enables development of efficient and effective computational schemes, such as the FFT. Since many systems  change in time, it becomes of interest to generalize classical spectral analysis to the time-varying setting. In addition, classical methods suffer from resolution limits which we hope to surpass. In this topics course, we follow two threads. On the one hand,  we consider the ¿estimation of instantaneous frequencies and decomposition of source signals, which may be time-varying¿. The thread begins with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for non-stationary signal decomposition into intrinsic mode functions (IMF¿s), introduced by N. Huang et al [1], together with its machinery of the sifting process and computation of the Hilbert spectrum, resulting in the so-called adaptive harmonic model (AHM).nNext, this thread considers the wavelet synchrosqueezing transform (WSST) proposed by Daubechies et al [2],  which attempts to  estimate instantaneous frequencies (IF¿s), via the frequency re-assignment (FRA) rule, that facilitaes non-stationary signal decomposition. In reference [3], a real-time method is proposed for computing the FRA rule; and in reference [4], the exact number of AHM components is determined with more precise estimation of the IF¿s, for more accurate extraction of the signal components and polynomial-like trend. nIn another thread, recent developments in optimization have been applied to obtain time-varying spectra or very high-resolution spectra; in particular, references [5]-[8] give examples of recent results where convex estimation is  applied to obtain new and more highly resolved spectral estimates, some with time-varying structure.

It aims to extend Shannon's point-to-point information theory and the Ford-Fulkerson max-flow min-cut theorem to networks with multiple sources and destinations. The course presents the basic results and tools in the field in a simple and unified manner. Topics covered include: multiple access channels, broadcast channels, interference channels, channels with state, distributed source coding, multiple description coding, network coding, relay channels, interactive communication, and noisy network coding. Prerequisites: EE376A.

STATS42Q | Undergraduate Admissions to Selective Universities - a Statistical Perspective | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=STATS42Q | instructors: description:The goal is the building of a statistical model, based on applicant data, for predicting admission to selective universities.  The model will consider factors such as gender, ethnicity, legacy status, public-private schooling, test scores, effects of early action, and athletics.  Common misconceptions and statistical pitfalls are investigated.  The applicant data are not those associated with any specific university.
