STATS 48N | Riding the Data Wave | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=STATS 48N | Imagine collecting a bit of your saliva and sending it in to one of the personalized genomics company: for very little money you will get back information about hundreds of thousands of variable sites in your genome. Records of exposure to a variety of chemicals in the areas you have lived are only a few clicks away on the web; as are thousands of studies and informal reports on the effects of different diets, to which you can compare your own. What does this all mean for you? Never before in history humans have recorded so much information about themselves and the world that surrounds them. Nor has this data been so readily available to the lay person. Expression as "data deluge'' are used to describe such wealth as well as the loss of proper bearings that it often generates.  How to summarize all this information in a useful way? How to boil down millions of numbers to just a meaningful few? How to convey the gist of the story in a picture without misleading oversimplifications? To answer these questions we need to consider the use of the data, appreciate the diversity that they represent, and understand how people instinctively interpret numbers and pictures. During each week, we will consider a different data set  to be summarized with a different goal. We will review analysis of similar problems carried out in the past and explore if and how the same tools can be useful today. We will pay attention to contemporary media (newspapers, blogs, etc.) to identify settings similar to the ones we are examining and critique the displays and summaries there documented. Taking an experimental approach, we will evaluate the effectiveness of different data summaries in conveying the desired information by testing them on subsets of the enrolled students.

STATS 333 | Modern Spectral Analysis | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=STATS 333 | Traditional spectral analysis encompassed Fourier methods and their elaborations, under the assumption of a simple superposition of sinusoids, independent of time. This enables development of efficient and effective computational schemes, such as the FFT. Since many systems  change in time, it becomes of interest to generalize classical spectral analysis to the time-varying setting. In addition, classical methods suffer from resolution limits which we hope to surpass. In this topics course, we follow two threads. On the one hand,  we consider the ¿estimation of instantaneous frequencies and decomposition of source signals, which may be time-varying¿. The thread begins with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for non-stationary signal decomposition into intrinsic mode functions (IMF¿s), introduced by N. Huang et al [1], together with its machinery of the sifting process and computation of the Hilbert spectrum, resulting in the so-called adaptive harmonic model (AHM).nNext, this thread considers the wavelet synchrosqueezing transform (WSST) proposed by Daubechies et al [2],  which attempts to  estimate instantaneous frequencies (IF¿s), via the frequency re-assignment (FRA) rule, that facilitaes non-stationary signal decomposition. In reference [3], a real-time method is proposed for computing the FRA rule; and in reference [4], the exact number of AHM components is determined with more precise estimation of the IF¿s, for more accurate extraction of the signal components and polynomial-like trend. nIn another thread, recent developments in optimization have been applied to obtain time-varying spectra or very high-resolution spectra; in particular, references [5]-[8] give examples of recent results where convex estimation is  applied to obtain new and more highly resolved spectral estimates, some with time-varying structure.
