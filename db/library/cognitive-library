LINGUIST1 | Introduction to Linguistics | http://LINGUIST1.stanford.edu | instructors:Sumner, M. (PI) description:This course introduces students to the cognitive organization of linguistic structure and the social nature of language use. We will investigate language as it is used in our everyday lives, highlighting both the variability and systematic nature of all levels of linguistic structure.  In doing so, we will discover how to approach language from a scientific perspective, learn the fundamentals of linguistic analysis, and understand the foundational concepts of the field of Linguistics.  Sample topics to be explored across a variety of languages include language and advertising, language change, dialect variation, and language and technology.  *** Sections are mandatory.

Minsky term:G (Spring) textbook:The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind (Minsky, Marvin)  description:Introduction to a theory that tries to explain how minds are made from collections of simpler processes. Treats such aspects of thinking as vision, language, learning, reasoning, memory, consciousness, ideals, emotions, and personality. Incorporates ideas from psychology, artificial intelligence, and computer science to resolve theoretical issues such as wholes vs. parts, structural vs. functional descriptions, declarative vs. procedural representations, symbolic vs. connectionist models, and logical vs. common-sense theories of learning.

PSYCH263 | Cognitive Neuroscience: Vision | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PSYCH263 | instructors:Gardner, J. (PI) description:Decision, categorization. Bayesian inference, working memory, attention, cognitive control, conscious perception and awareness. The neural basis for all of these cognitive functions have been extensively studied in the domain of vision. Why vision? Because a great deal of scientific inquiry has delineated both the behavioral and physiological aspects of basic sensory processing in vision. Because of this, cognitive neuroscience questions can be precisely formulated in the context of vision. As a result we have some of the best answers to the question of what neural mechanisms underlie cognitive functions in the domain of vision. The course will combine lectures and in-depth discussions of primary literature to develop key concepts in the neuroscience of vision and how these concepts have been built on to understand the neural basis of higher cognition. Guest instructors will include Bill Newsome, Tirin Moore and Kalanit Grill-Spector. path:db/psychology/psychology-stanford2016

(TA) description:An overview of the interdisciplinary study of cognition, information, communication, and language, with an emphasis on foundational issues: What are minds? What is computation? What are rationality and intelligence? Can we predict human behavior? Can computers be truly intelligent? How do people and technology interact, and how might they do so in the future? Lectures focus on how the methods of philosophy, mathematics, empirical research, and computational modeling are used to study minds and machines. Undergraduates considering a major in symbolic systems should take this course as early as possible in their program of study. path:db/psychology/psychology-stanford2016
